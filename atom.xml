<p><em>This blog post is part of a series on State Machines. Read Part 1 <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/03/17/a-machine-state-of-mind-part-1-understanding-state-machines/">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>Until you encounter a state machine in a gem, framework, or within someone else&rsquo;s code, you probably won&rsquo;t find one very easily. But as we learned last week, they&rsquo;re rather pervasive. I discovered state machines while helping build a large-scale eCommerce website.</p>

<p>But there actually weren&rsquo;t even that many state machines in our code! We were relying on state machines that lived in the source code of a Rails library with a variety of gems, commonly referred to as <a href="https://github.com/spree">spree</a>. (Why reinvent ecommerce platforms when so many people have already made &lsquo;em, amirite?)</p>

<p>So, I did what any self-respecting, completely unaware new developer would do: I dove into the spree source code. And boy, was <em>that</em> a rabbit hole. But, I learned some things about how state machines work in Rails and how to make them. It&rsquo;s good to conceptually understand the theory behind state machines, but the best way to learn something is by doing it. It&rsquo;s time to take off the training wheels and actually <em>build</em> our own state machine!</p>

<h2>Starting Up The Machine Engine</h2>

<p>There are a few different options for implementing state machines in a Rails application; spree, for example, uses the <a href="https://github.com/pluginaweek/state_machine/tree/master">state_machine plugin</a>. Personally, I prefer the <a href="https://github.com/aasm/aasm">acts_as_state_machine gem</a> (aasm), as I&rsquo;ve found it to be a bit easier to use and understand.</p>

<p>Once we <code>gem install aasm</code> and add it to our application&rsquo;s <code>Gemfile</code>, we&rsquo;ll want to include it in the body of the class we&rsquo;re trying to implement the state machine on. In the case of our bookstore application, our <code>Order</code> objects are what will be transitioning from one state to another. As the application begins to grow, it&rsquo;ll be useful to namespace our objects (<code>Book::Order</code>) before including the module:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Book</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Order</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">AASM</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Including the gem is the easy part. The next part is slightly trickier, yet remains pretty intuitive. First, we&rsquo;ll start by defining two states: an initial <code>state</code> that we want our object to start off in, and a second <code>state</code> we want our object to transition to. Then, we&rsquo;ll want to adding an <code>event</code> with an <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> in its <code>transition</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">aasm</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">state</span> <span class="ss">:unplaced</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:initial</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">state</span> <span class="ss">:submitted</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">event</span> <span class="ss">:submit</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">transitions</span> <span class="ss">:from</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:unplaced</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:to</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:submitted</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Notice that the <code>event :submit</code> is the present tense verb form of the <code>state :submitted</code>. And when the <code>submit</code> event is called, the <code>Book::Order</code> object&rsquo;s <code>state</code> will transition from one state to the other.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much all you really need to implement a state machine. But of course, we&rsquo;ve only got two states here, which isn&rsquo;t really much of a machine and definitely doesn&rsquo;t take advantage of all the functionalities that <code>aasm</code> provides us with.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s continue to build on the state machine based on <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Nd3ityK.png">the diagram</a> from last week&rsquo;s post and add a few more states and events:</p>

<p>Whoa &ndash; now we&rsquo;re talking! This state machine is even more complex than the diagram we started off with!</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that we even have a <code>state :returned</code> and an <code>event :return</code>, which transition from a <code>complete</code> state to a <code>returned</code> one. And if you&rsquo;ve got a really good eye, you&rsquo;ll see that the <code>process</code> event has changed, too. Now, we can call the <code>process</code> event on the object when it&rsquo;s either in the <code>submitted</code> state or the <code>returned</code> state.</p>

<p>Our state machine is now a <em>self-referential</em> structure, which means that the <code>process</code> event looks back to states within the machine to determine whether it can continue forward or not. This all seems pretty cool, but you better buckle in &ndash; it&rsquo;s about to get <em>even cooler</em>.</p>

<h2>Test Driving Your Machine</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s lovely that we have this machine and all, but what&rsquo;s the fun if you can&rsquo;t take it out for a whirl? So, let&rsquo;s see what this thing can do.</p>

<p>This gem in particular provides us with a variety of public methods for any instances of our <code>Book::Order</code> class, all via our state machine:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">order</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Book</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Order</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span> <span class="c1"># =&gt; =&gt; #&lt;Book::Order:0x007fad3d51aa30&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">order</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">unplaced?</span>         <span class="c1"># =&gt; true</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">order</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">may_submit?</span>       <span class="c1"># =&gt; true</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">order</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">submit</span>            <span class="c1"># calls the `submit` event</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">order</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">submitted?</span>        <span class="c1"># =&gt; true</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">order</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">unplaced?</span>         <span class="c1"># =&gt; false</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">order</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">may_submit?</span>       <span class="c1"># =&gt; false</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">order</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">submit</span>            <span class="c1"># =&gt; raises AASM::InvalidTransition</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>Protip</em>: If you&rsquo;re not a big fan of raising exceptions in your application, just add <code>aasm :whiny_transitions =&gt; false do</code> right inside of your class, and you&rsquo;ll return basic <code>boolean</code> values instead of exceptions.</p>

<p>Whew! So that&rsquo;s a lot of methods. But we didn&rsquo;t have to write <em>any</em> of them! Isn&rsquo;t that fantastic? Hopefully the usefulness of state machines is starting to come together now. Remember before we knew what a state machine was? How would we have had to handle all of this functionality?</p>

<p>We would&rsquo;ve had to do all of the following, multiple times:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make a migration that adds a <code>state</code> or <code>status</code> column in our <code>Book::Object</code> class, with a <code>string</code> value.</li>
<li>Give the <code>state</code> column an initial default value of <code>unplaced</code>.</li>
<li>Add an instance method called <code>unplaced?</code> with a <code>boolean</code> return value.</li>
<li>Add another instance method called <code>submit</code>, which changes the object&rsquo;s <code>state</code> property from <code>"unplaced"</code> to <code>"submitted"</code>.</li>
<li>Add yet <em>another</em> instance method called <code>submitted?</code>, with (at the very least), a single-line <code>if</code> conditional.</li>
<li>Add some more instance methods for good measure, all with some logic in them to keep track of our object&rsquo;s <code>state</code>.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 3-6 for every single new <code>state</code> we wanted to add.</li>
</ol>

<p><br></p>

<p>If we compare this horrifying list to our state machine, it&rsquo;s pretty clear that our machine takes care of all of this! Yes, it requires a little bit of setup when we create our class, but come on, it&rsquo;s like, four lines of code for each state! So much better. And you get all these methods for free! And they&rsquo;re pretty powerful, because we can call them anywhere in our code, on any instance of our object.</p>

<p>But can we customize this machine even further? Heck yes, we can!</p>

<h2>Trick Out Yo&#8217; Ride</h2>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve created a basic state machine, we can trick it out with any (or all!) of these options:</p>

<h3>1. Pass a block to an <code>event</code></h3>

<p>Whenever you want a specific event to call a particular method, simply pass a block to the method. The block will only be called if the transition occurs successfully.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># will the `send_order_shipped_email`</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># method actually fire.</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>2. Use a callback</h3>

<p>The <code>aasm</code> documentation defines a list of different callbacks you can use for your transitions; the callbacks will only be triggered when certain conditions are met (for example, when you exit a particular <code>state</code>).</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1"># that the `Order` has been deleted.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>These callbacks work exactly as you might think, hooking into either a state or an event. Before the <code>Order</code> switches states from <code>processed</code> to <code>shipped</code>, the <code>print_return_label</code> method will fire. But the <code>send_delete_confirmation</code> method will only be called after the <code>delete event</code> is finished &ndash; only after the transition from <code>processing</code> to <code>deleted</code> occurs successfully.</p>

<h3>3. Implement a guard</h3>

<p>If you want to only allow a transition if a particular condition is defined; if the guard returns <code>false</code>, the transition will be denied, and will either return <code>false</code> or raise an error.</p>

<p>These are just three things you can do to spice up your state machine. Creating a state machine with this gem gives you a fair amount of flexibility. You can use multiple guards or build multiple transitions for a single event. As your state machine grows, you can call the <code>aasm.current_event</code> to keep track of where you are in your code.</p>

<p>Now that you know how to implement a state machine, hopefully you now realize the value in them and don&rsquo;t feel too intimidated. As long as you take it a step at a time, you can create your own state machine, with the exact kind of functionality your program needs. With that said, there&rsquo;s only one thing left to do: go forth implement one yourself! Fly young grasshopper, fly!</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>State machines can be broken down into <code>states</code> and <code>events</code>. Events control the flow of one <code>state</code> to another.</li>
<li>Each <code>event</code> has a <code>from</code> and a <code>to transition</code>. Only if a transition occurs successfully will an object&rsquo;s <code>state</code> change. You can manipulate how an event or transition works using callbacks, blocks, and guards.</li>

<p>My favorite thing about programming is the fact that you never run out of opportunities to be completely floored. There&rsquo;s literally <em>always</em> either a concept, theory, framework, or language that you don&rsquo;t know. This is actually fantastic, because there&rsquo;s no dearth of opportunity when it comes to learning. And you always come head-to-head with these facts when you pair program with a more experienced developer.</p>

<p>One of the new concepts that I encountered this week was the idea of <strong>state machines</strong>, sometimes referred to as &ldquo;finite state machines&rdquo;. At first I thought that this was something unique to the gem that we are using in one of our large-scale applications, but it turns out it&rsquo;s not a Rails thing. In fact, it&rsquo;s not even a Ruby thing! It&rsquo;s a <em>Computer Science</em> thing; to be a bit more specific, it&rsquo;s a mathematical abstraction used to design complex algorithms. But for all intents and purposes, it&rsquo;s a Computer Science theory that we use almost all the time, whether we know it or not.</p>

<p>If you got through that paragraph without freaking out, you deserve a medal. All this CS theory sounds terrifying, right? Well, don&rsquo;t worry. For programming purposes, you don&rsquo;t actually need to think too much about how state machines are constructed and what&rsquo;s being abstracted away. Even though state machines can get incredibly complex, relatively quickly, let&rsquo;s not overwhelm ourselves; we only need to think about state machines in the context of programming. So we&rsquo;ll keep it simple and focus on what state machines are, how they work, and when to use them.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>State Machines: What Are They?</h2>

<p>A state machine is nothing more than a flow chart. And here&rsquo;s the thing about flowcharts: <em>they&rsquo;re everywhere</em>. If you think about it, a flowchart is just a way of controlling the flow of a set of actions. You have different conditions, and depending on your condition &ndash; or &ldquo;state&rdquo;, as we refer to it in programmatic terms &ndash; you&rsquo;ll take a certain action.</p>

<p>For example, if you&rsquo;re hungry, you&rsquo;ll eat some food, probably a slice of cheesecake. If you&rsquo;re still hungry, you&rsquo;ll eat another slice. When you&rsquo;re full, you&rsquo;ll stop eating cheesecake (LOL, like anyone could ever be &ldquo;too full&rdquo; from cheesecake). You have different states of being, and certain events trigger you to move from one state to another &ndash; from hungry, to less hungry, to completely full.</p>

<p>One of the simplest definitions that I found for state machines in the context of programming comes from a <a href="http://lamsonproject.org/docs/introduction_to_finite_state_machines.html">Lamson Project blog post</a> :</p>

<blockquote><p>A practical finite state machine is basically four things: 1) A bunch of functions, or things that need to get done. 2) A bunch of events, or reasons to call these functions. 3) Some piece of data that tracks the &ldquo;state&rdquo; this bunch of functions is in. 4) Code inside the functions that says how to &ldquo;transition&rdquo; or &ldquo;change&rdquo; into the next state for further processing.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the risk of sounding a bit philosophical, it all boils down to actions that are taken, and the reasons we take certain actions. State machines are how we keep track of different events, and control the flow between those events.</p>

<h2>A State Of Being: How to Use State Machines</h2>

<p>The best way of understanding <em>how</em> to use a state machine in your own application is by seeing an example of it in another application. A good place to start is usually a commonly-used, large-scale web application. Since we&rsquo;ve been using my bookstore application in <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/03/10/its-all-in-the-family-using-acts-as-tree/">prior blog posts</a>, we&rsquo;ll use another eCommerce example to understand state machines. Here&rsquo;s a very simplified example of a basic order processing state machine:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Nd3ityK.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<p>If we follow the event flow, we start to get an idea of the different actions that trigger different states. Each <code>Order</code> starts off with an initial state (something that we&rsquo;ll explore a bit more when we build our own state machine), and requires a certain event to occur for its state to change. This means that only if an <code>Order</code> is <em>placed</em>, will the <code>Order</code>&rsquo;s state be changed to <code>submitted</code>.</p>

<p>The event triggers are important because without them, there wouldn&rsquo;t be enough clarity to move from one state to another. Take a look at the <code>Order</code> when it&rsquo;s in the <code>processing</code> state. The <code>Order</code> must be either <code>fulfilled</code> or <code>canceled</code> in order for it to proceed to the next state.</p>

<p>This particular state machine is <em>very</em> simple, and doesn&rsquo;t even account for the return or refund process! Imagine what that might look like! You could have states that could have events that <em>refer back</em> to themselves, which would make them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graphs</a>. Things would start to get really complicated, really fast.</p>

<p>But, if we think back to the Lamson Project&rsquo;s definition of a state machine, our order processing example still fits the bill:</p>

<ol>
<li>Our <strong>functions</strong>, the stuff that needs to get done, are the different things that need to happen for an event to trigger. For example, the <code>User</code> has to input a valid credit card number, cvv, expiration date, and shipping address just so that the <code>Order</code> can transition from <code>unplaced</code> to <code>submitted</code>.</li>
<li>Our <strong>events</strong>, the reasons to call the functions, are the actual actions taken during the flow of the machine. The <code>User</code> actually has to successfully <em>submit</em> the form and the data has to be passed from the <code>User</code> and stored in the database so that the event can successfully occur.</li>
<li>Our <strong>states</strong>, the data that tracks these functions, are the different conditions that our order can be in. If the <code>Order</code> is <code>processing</code>, all the functionality of fulfilling, packaging, and shipping the order must all be contained within that state.</li>
<li>Our <strong>code inside the functions</strong> would be all the intricate methods that do all the work prior to each event occurring and each state changing. For example, you&rsquo;d probably have a validation to check whether the user had input a valid zip code (something like <code>validates :zip_code_length</code>) before transitioning from an <code>unplaced</code> <code>Order</code> to a <code>submitted</code> one. And you&rsquo;d probably want to execute an <code>in_stock?</code> method before switching from the <code>processing</code> state to the <code>shipped</code> state.</li>
</ol>


<h2>The Case For State Machines</h2>

<p>While understanding state machines is great, is it always the right tool for the job? From my research and reading, it seems like most of the time, it is. <a href="http://www.skorks.com/2011/09/why-developers-never-use-state-machines/">This post</a> by Alan Skorkin gives some pretty good insight into <em>why</em> developers never use state machines. Many developers seem to be intimidated by the very concept of state machines, or sometimes don&rsquo;t even understand them in the first place, which can be cause to avoid them at all costs. Other programmers see them as complex and overly complicated, and perhaps not necessary when you&rsquo;re first starting off in building your application. And sometimes it&rsquo;s just hard to foresee how your application is going to grow, and determine whether or not a state machine is the right tool for the job.</p>

<p>Even though setting up a state machine takes a bit of initial effort, it can save you a lot of pain in the long run. Even though many programmers can&rsquo;t predict when they&rsquo;ll need a state machine, almost every application has some form of flow that fits the bill. And let&rsquo;s face it: almost every web application these days actually strives to <em>do</em> something, which means that it will inevitably have some sort of flow of events.</p>

<p>This fantastic <a href="http://www.shopify.com/technology/3383012-why-developers-should-be-force-fed-state-machines">Shopify blog post</a> makes a great case for why ever programmer needs to be &ldquo;force-fed&rdquo; the state machine concept. The most important part of all of this debate, however, is understanding the state machine pattern. You have to understand the pattern first, and then you can figure out whether you need to spend the time in actually implementing it.</p>

<p>Thankfully, there are a few common red flags that indicate if this is the case:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A <code>state</code> or a <code>status</code> attribute on any of your objects: <code>Book::Order.first.status</code></p></li>
<li><p>Instance methods that return a <code>boolean</code> value: <code>Book::Order.first.shipped?</code></p></li>
<li><p>Records that are only valid for a certain period of time: <code>User::Membership.first.subscriptions #=&gt; "expired"</code></p></li>
</ol>


<p>If your code base has any of these, you can probably benefit from a state machine. I went back and looked at my old web apps, and found that each and every one of them had at least one, if not more, of these situations. In fact, almost every Rails application is bound to have some variation of these three different scenarios, which means that we should all learn how to use state machines and become better developers!</p>

<p>So how do you actually go about creating a state machine? Well, that&rsquo;s a whole other <del>game</del> blog post entirely. Tune in again next Tuesday, when I&rsquo;ll explore how to actually go about <em>implementing</em> a state machine in your Rails application! Get excited! Like this:</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>State machines control the flow of events in a web application by using certain events to trigger different states or conditions.</li>
<li>If you find that your app has methods like <code>state</code> or <code>status</code> and <code>shipped?</code> or <code>received?</code>, you should try using a state machine.</li>

<p><br></p>

<p>When working in Rails, it&rsquo;s all the family &ndash; literally. No matter the size of your application, almost all of your objects are going to be related to each other. You can create however many objects you wan because database rows are cheap, cheap, cheap! But the more objects you make, the harder it is to keep track of the other data that the object relates to (which is generally yet <em>another</em> object).</p>

<p>I found myself in such a predicament last week, when I had to make numerous objects relate to one other to create a tree structure. The obvious first approach was to use the <code>belongs_to</code> and <code>has_many</code> relationship. But when I realized that I wanted some <code>Genre</code> objects to belong to <em>other</em> <code>Genre</code> objects, I ran into a problem. Depending solely on the ActiveRecord relationships turned out to be painful, messy, and complicated, and wouldn&rsquo;t make my code very flexible or sustainable over time.</p>

<p>So I Googled around and found a handy plugin created by DHH himself called <code>acts_as_tree</code>. This gem allows you to create a hierarchical structure of objects in your application and &ndash; to take it a step further &ndash; gives you a bunch of incredibly helpful methods. It even allows you to visualize your tree structure! Sound amazing? That&rsquo;s because it is. And if you follow a few easy steps, you can use it in your application, too.</p>

<h2>Family Ties</h2>

<p>So, for this post I&rsquo;ll continue working through my basic eCommerce Bookstore application, which I&rsquo;ve been using as an example for my previous posts. I&rsquo;ve already got some <code>Book</code> objects, but as my store starts to grow, it&rsquo;s going to be pretty hard to keep track of the different genres of <code>Book</code> objects that I currently have available.</p>

<p>The first step to tackling this problem was easy: create <code>Genre</code> objects, each of which <code>has_many</code> different <code>Book</code> objects associated with it, while each <code>Book</code> object will <code>belong_to</code> one specific <code>Genre</code>.</p>

<p>But what about genres that are associated with and &ldquo;descend from&rdquo; other genres? Well, here&rsquo;s where the delightful and easy-to-use <code>acts_as_tree</code> gem comes in.</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/pcPeWllpmv6Zq" width="480" height="431" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p><br></p>

<p>First things first: we&rsquo;ll add <code>gem 'acts_as_tree'</code> to our Gemfile.</p>

<p>Next, we need to add a column to our <code>Genre</code> database. We can write a simple migration that will add a <code>parent_id</code> integer to our database, which will allow us to find the parents and children of a <code>Genre</code> object:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">AddParentIdColumnToGenre</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Migration</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">change</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">add_column</span> <span class="ss">:genres</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:parent_id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:integer</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Finally, we&rsquo;ll head over to our <code>Genre</code> model, which is what we needs to act as a (family) tree. We need to add a single line in here, which implements the ActiveRecord plugin and specifies what we&rsquo;ll be ordering our <code>Genre</code> objects by:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Genre</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">has_many</span> <span class="ss">:books</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">validates_presence_of</span> <span class="ss">:name</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">acts_as_tree</span> <span class="ss">order</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;name&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Blood Is Thicker Than Water</h2>

<p>Okay, now let&rsquo;s see this baby in action! We can start by making a root <code>Genre</code> object, and then giving it some children:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">literature</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Genre</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;name&quot;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Literature&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">non_fiction</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">literature</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">children</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;name&quot;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Non-Fiction&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">fiction</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">literature</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">children</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;name&quot;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Fiction&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Cool, but our tree doesn&rsquo;t really look like a tree yet. Let&rsquo;s give our <code>non_fiction</code> and <code>fiction</code> genres some children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of their own:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<h2>It Runs In The Family</h2>

<p>Even though we&rsquo;ve created all these parent-child relationships, what can we do with them, exactly? Well, a lot! You can call the <code>parent</code> and <code>children</code> methods to get a full list of all the objects associated with a particular <code>Genre</code> instance:</p>

<p>An important thing to note here is that the <code>children</code> method will return an <em>array</em> of objects, even if there&rsquo;s only one child! So if you&rsquo;re trying to get one particular object, remember to call the <code>first</code> method in the array, or search by a <code>Genre</code> object&rsquo;s specific <code>id</code> to avoid annoying bugs.</p>

<p>Some other cool methods to try include:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>leaves</code>, a class method that will return all the &ldquo;leaves&rdquo; of the tree (in an array).</p></li>
<li><p><code>descendants</code>, an instance method that will return all the children, and the children&rsquo;s children of an object (in an array).</p></li>
<li><p><code>self_and_siblings</code>, which returns the receiver object, as well as any siblings it may have (in an array).</p></li>
<li><p><code>default_tree_order</code>, which returns all the objects listed in alphabetical order!</p></li>
</ol>


<p>But the coolest feature of the <code>acts_as_tree</code> gem is Tree View, which allows you to see a visualization of your entire tree. All we have to do view this magic is add this line to our <code>Genre</code> model:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="kp">extend</span> <span class="no">ActsAsTree</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">TreeView</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And then, call the class method <code>tree_view</code>, which takes in an attribute parameter:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Genre</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tree_view</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:name</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The resulting return value is pure flora magic:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<li>A lot of people seem to like the <a href="https://github.com/stefankroes/ancestry"><code>ancestry</code> gem</a>, but I think that <code>acts_as_tree</code> is a good one to start off with. If you need the extra functionality that <code>ancestry</code> provides, then you can eventually level up to that. Another variation on the <code>acts_as_tree</code>  is the <a href="https://github.com/chrisroberts/acts_as_sane_tree"><code>acts_as_sane_tree</code> gem</a>, which is configured for PostgreSQL 8.4 and comes with some cool extra methods (but isn&rsquo;t nearly as massive as ancestry).</li>

<p>Snowmageddon. Snowpocalypse. The Deep Freeze of 2015. You can call it whatever you want, but we can all agree on one thing: it&rsquo;s so damn cold outside. In fact, it&rsquo;s so cold that I recently saw this error message while debugging a Postgres issue:
<code>RuntimeError: can't modify frozen Hash</code></p>

<p>My first thought was, naturally, <em>holy shit, even my hashes are frozen</em>. I did a little digging, and it turns out that we aren&rsquo;t the only ones susceptible to these chilly temperatures. Apparently, objects can also freeze!</p>

<p>So, in honor of the frozen tundra that we all seem to currently inhabit, I decided to explore the icy-cold depths of Rails frozen objects. Before you read on though, you should know: I&rsquo;m going to use only gifs from the Disney animated film, <em>Frozen</em> — don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn you.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Objects As Cold As Ice</h2>

<p>First things first: what&rsquo;s a frozen object? Well, they&rsquo;re frozen, which means they can&rsquo;t change &ndash; they&rsquo;re immutable and cannot be modified. There are some objects in Ruby that are perpetually frozen, such as any <code>Fixnum</code>, <code>Bignum</code>, <code>Float</code>, and <code>Symbol</code> objects.</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/Fjy5XItIvYjEQ" width="480" height="269" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p><br></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve probably worked with all of these objects before, but may not know that they&rsquo;re actually frozen! Don&rsquo;t believe me? Well, you can check for yourself. Just call the <code>frozen?</code> method on any object of this class:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ irb
</span><span class='line'>2.2.0 :001 &gt; 1.frozen?
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; true
</span><span class='line'>2.2.0 :002 &gt; a = :im_a_symbol
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; :im_a_symbol
</span><span class='line'>2.2.0 :003 &gt; a.frozen?
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; true
</span><span class='line'>2.2.0 :004 &gt; 3.14.frozen?
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; true</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This kind of makes sense though, right? Imagine if I could just start rewriting values all over the damn place. I could set <code>1</code> equal to <code>nil</code> and make <code>2</code> equal <code>3</code>, and then we&rsquo;d really hit crazytown.</p>

<p>Frozen objects keep certain things secure and certain in Ruby (and also in Rails!) So, freezing objects is a&hellip;good thing? Well, yes. But also, no.</p>

<h2>The Freeze Method: A Cold Piece Of Work</h2>

<p>Just as there&rsquo;s a method to check whether an object is <code>frozen?</code> or not, there&rsquo;s also a method to freeze mutable objects and make them immutable called &ndash; you guessed it &ndash; <code>freeze</code>. This method is pretty simple: yuo just call it on an object in order to rpevent further modifications to said object. If you <em>do</em> try to modify the object after freezing it, you&rsquo;ll get a <code>RuntimeError</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>2.2.0 :005 &gt; x = {1 =&gt; 'a', 2 =&gt; 'b', 3 =&gt; 'c'}
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; {1=&gt;"a", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}
</span><span class='line'>2.2.0 :006 &gt; x.freeze
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; {1=&gt;"a", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}
</span><span class='line'>2.2.0 :007 &gt; x.frozen?
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; true
</span><span class='line'>2.2.0 :008 &gt; x[1] = 'b'
</span><span class='line'>RuntimeError: can't modify frozen Hash</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>But before you get all Elsa on me and start freezing everything, you should know some things about how to use the <code>freeze</code> method as a responsible developer:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First and foremost: don&rsquo;t try to call a <code>defrost</code> or <code>thaw</code> method, because there&rsquo;s no such thing. In fact, there is <em>absolutely no way</em> to unfreeze an object. It simply cannot be undone. So, proceed with great caution when freezing things. Or maybe just don&rsquo;t do it at all.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>freeze</code> method operates on an object reference, not on a variable. Wait, whut? If this sounds like Ruby objects aren&rsquo;t actually being modified, but their references are instead, well&hellip;that&rsquo;s totally right.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I really liked the way that Michael Morin explained this in <a href="http://ruby.about.com/od/qa/ss/Can-T-Modify-Frozen-String.htm">his post</a> on frozen objects:</p>

<blockquote><p>When you freeze a hash, it just freezes the references to the objects it already has, it doesn&rsquo;t actually freeze the objects themselves. The frozen hash won&rsquo;t know the difference here. This is an important thing to understand about freezing objects, it&rsquo;s not recursive. All freezing does is prevent the references the object holds from being modified.</p></blockquote>

<p>While we can&rsquo;t unfreeze &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; objects, this particular quality gives us a little bit leeway to get around the lack of a thaw method.</p>

<h2>Chill Out, But Don&rsquo;t Freeze</h2>

<p>There are a few different ways to change an immutable frozen object (which, hello, aren&rsquo;t actually frozen, just their references are). One thing you can do is create a duplicated object, which will <em>not</em> be frozen and therefore, completely mutable:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>2.2.0 :009 &gt; x.dup
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; {1=&gt;"a", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}
</span><span class='line'>2.2.0 :010 &gt; y = _
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; {1=&gt;"a", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}
</span><span class='line'>2.2.0 :011 &gt; y.frozen?
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; false
</span><span class='line'>2.2.0 :012 &gt; x.frozen?
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; true
</span><span class='line'>2.2.0 :013 &gt; y[1] = 'b'
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "b"
</span><span class='line'>2.2.0 :014 &gt; y
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; {1=&gt;"b", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Keep in mind, however, that this only changes the data in the duplicated object, not the original one! So&hellip;what now? Well, since only the reference to an object is frozen, that means that you can modify the actual data inside of the frozen object:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>2.2.0 :015 &gt; x[1] &lt;&lt; 'bc'
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "ab"
</span><span class='line'>2.2.0 :016 &gt; x
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; {1=&gt;"abc", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}
</span><span class='line'>2.2.0 :017 &gt; x.frozen?
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; true</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Weird, right!? Our <code>x</code> variable, which points to the <code>Hash</code> object, is still very much frozen. But, we can modify the data and values inside of the object itself. Since we don&rsquo;t want to make an actual copy of the variable, we can instead modify the objects held within that variable (in our case, we&rsquo;re directly modifying the <code>String</code> object, which is a the value of a key in this frozen Hash)</p>

<h2>Freezing Out Those Error Messages</h2>

<p>Cool, so this I guess this is a thing in Ruby. But wait &ndash; it&rsquo;s also a pretty important thing in Rails! Objects in Rails are infinitely more complicated than in Ruby, mostly because you&rsquo;re dealing with ActiveRecord and its methods. Whenever you&rsquo;re trying to delete an ActiveRecord object, you depend on the <code>destroy</code> method.</p>

<p>For example, I use this method in my bookstore app, and I have a <code>delete</code> action in my <code>BooksController</code> that contains code that looks something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="vi">@book</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Book</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="vi">@book</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">destroy</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now if I wanted to modfiy this book&rsquo;s type after I delete it, I&rsquo;d get an error:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="n">pry</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">main</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="vi">@book</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;hardcover&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="ss">TypeError</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">can</span><span class="err">&#39;</span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="n">modify</span> <span class="n">frozen</span> <span class="nb">hash</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Why is this? Well, even though I deleted the object, it still exists in the <code>@book</code> variable, which still retains all the attributes of the object. Once I destroy the record, the object became frozen. Since the object&rsquo;s attributes hash is frozen, when I try to modify it, I get this error.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Persistence.html#method-i-destroy">Rails documentation</a> explains how it implements the <code>freeze</code> method, stating that <code>destroy</code> method:</p>

<blockquote><p>Deletes the record in the database and freezes this instance to reflect that no changes should be made (since they can&rsquo;t be persisted).</p></blockquote>

<p>To avoid creating a <code>@book</code> object that&rsquo;s frozen and still hanging around for no apparent reason, I could instead implicitly delete the object in a single line. Either this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Book</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="n">destroy</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>or</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Book</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">destroy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>would work.</p>

<p>Alternatively, I could just use the <code>delete</code> method, which doesn&rsquo;t instantiate an object, but isntead directly removes the row from the database.</p>

<p>Frozen objects are in front of us everyday. Ruby actually uses the <code>freeze</code> method when you copy certain objects. According to <a href="http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/mutable_and_immutable_objects.html">this post</a>, when you use a string as a key of a <code>Hash</code> object, the string is copied, frozen, and then that duplicated copy is used as the key of the hash. This is pretty cool because this means that even if the original string is modified, the duplicated one isn&rsquo;t affected because it has been frozen! The same goes for filenames: internal operations of an application rely on a frozen copy of a filename, rather than the original one.</p>

<p>Once you understand the functionality of <code>freeze</code>, it becomes a lot easier to understand those weird error messages. Soon, you&rsquo;ll no longer fear the ice, but instead bask in the sun. Or&hellip;something more poetic.</p>

<p>Anyways, here&rsquo;s a dancing snowman:</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>You can use the <code>freeze</code> method to make mutable objects immutable. To check whether an object can be modified or not, use the <code>frozen?</code> method, which will return a boolean value.</li>
<li>Certain Ruby objects, such as integers, floats, and symbols, are always frozen and cannot be modified.</li>
<li>Someone made a <a href="https://github.com/zizkovrb/melt">melt gem</a> &ndash; for realsies!</li>
<li>Some people are <a href="http://m.onkey.org/ruby-i-don-t-like-3-object-freeze">not big fans</a> of the weird functionality of Ruby <code>freeze</code>. But it&rsquo;s still worth it to <a href="http://blog.adamstegman.com/activerecord-hangs-on-to-destroyed-relations.html">learn how it works</a>, especially since it can be <a href="http://blog.adamstegman.com/activerecord-hangs-on-to-destroyed-relations.html">super helpful</a> for <a href="http://www.devarticles.com/c/a/Ruby-on-Rails/Updating-and-Deleting-with-the-Active-Record/2/">debugging Rails apps</a>.</li>

<p>Are you with me? Did you make it past the second line? Do I need to call an ambulance? Well, if your reaction was anything like mine, you saw <code>class &lt;&lt; self</code> and experienced something akin to an aneurysm.</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/ds8khI25lsR3y" width="480" height="255" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s agree on one thing right here, right now: everything in Ruby is an object. No matter how crazy it&rsquo;s about to get, just remember that. In fact, it&rsquo;s worth repeating again: <em>Everything in Ruby is an object &ndash; <strong>even a class</strong>.</em></p>

<p>Got it? Okay, now let&rsquo;s figure what the hell that code means, exactly.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Class Methods, Because Your Instances Should Never Be Too Greedy</h2>

<p>In order to understand the meaning behind <code>class &lt;&lt; self</code>, we first need to understand the <code>&lt;&lt; self</code> syntax. Let&rsquo;s recap a couple basics about class inheritance first:</p>

<ol>
<li>Classes can have two different types of methods: class methods, which can be called on a <code>Class</code> object, and instance methods, which can only be called on <em>instances</em> of a <code>Class</code> object.</li>
<li>There are multiple ways to create class methods:</li>
</ol>


<p>You can use <code>self</code> as the receiver of a method within a class, which is probably the most common way of defining a class method:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Book</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">type</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="s2">&quot;paperback&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can also define a method on the class name (for example, class <code>Book</code>), which implies that the entire <code>Class Book</code> object can receive the <code>type</code> method:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">Book</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">type</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="s2">&quot;paperback&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But, you can also do this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="no">Book</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">type</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="s2">&quot;paperback&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And &ndash; wait for it &ndash; this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Book</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">class</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="nb">self</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">type</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="s2">&quot;paperback&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Okay, so that funky <code>class &lt;&lt; self</code> syntax is just another way of defining a class method? But&hellip;but how?</p>

<h2>One Method To Rule Them All</h2>

<p>So, we know that class methods are a good place to put all the behavior and functionality of <em>all instances</em> of that class. If you want all instances of your <code>Book</code> objects to have a title and an author, you&rsquo;d want that behavior to be put into the <code>Book</code> class, since all instances of Book will inherit from their parent class.</p>

<p>But, what if you wanted a particular instance of a <code>Book</code> to have a specific kind of functionality. Well, you definitely wouldn&rsquo;t want to define a method on the class, because it&rsquo;s only a particular instance that you care about. So why not define a method on that particular instance, then?</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At first glance, nothing here seems all that weird, right? Both the books have access to the <code>type</code> class method, which we defined earlier, while only the <code>charlottes_web</code> <code>Book</code> object has access to the <code>wilbur</code> method. Ruby seems to know that the <code>wilbur</code> method is scoped only to this instance, but it also knows that this instance has other methods &ndash; class methods &ndash; that are also accessible to it. But how is this actually possible?</p>

<p>Well, the answer is for two reasons: <strong>singleton methods</strong> and Ruby&rsquo;s <strong>method lookup chain</strong>.</p>

<p>Singleton methods are methods defined on an object itself, rather than on an object&rsquo;s class. Ruby&rsquo;s method <a href="http://madebydna.com/images/posts/object_method_lookup.gif">lookup chain</a> is pretty intricate:</p>

<p><img src="http://madebydna.com/images/posts/object_method_lookup.gif" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<p>An object inherits from its class, and its class can inherit from many more objects, which will then inherit from <code>Object</code>, which inherits from the great grandma of all objects in Ruby: <code>BasicObject</code>. Remember: <em>everything in Ruby is an object &ndash; even a class.</em></p>

<p>So at this point, you&rsquo;re probably wondering what this has to do with class methods. Well, a lot, actually.</p>

<h2>A Class Of One&rsquo;s Own</h2>

<p>We can create all the singleton methods we want, but where do they all go? Not in the <code>Book</code> class, that&rsquo;s for sure. So where do we put them, exactly?</p>

<p>It turns out, an object&rsquo;s singleton methods all go into their own neat little class called an <strong>eigenclass</strong>, which is just another name for a singleton class. The word &ldquo;eigen&rdquo; comes from a German term meaning &ldquo;one&rsquo;s very own&rdquo;. I personally like to call it an eigenclass because it minimizes confusion between singleton methods and classes. Also, throwing down terms like <em>eigenclass</em> make you sound like a total badass.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the cool thing about eigenclasses: they&rsquo;re totally hidden. I should warn you though, the thing that makes them cool is the very same thing that makes them complicated. Because they&rsquo;re hidden and anonymous, you obviously can&rsquo;t see them and so it&rsquo;s hard to figure out where in the method lookup path they are. Here&rsquo;s the trick, though: whenever you open up an eigenclass, you shift up the original class.</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/jXMtxrFs292so" width="480" height="202" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p><br></p>

<p>In my book example, the <code>charlottes_web</code> object inherits from the <code>Book</code> class. But when I created the <code>wilbur</code> method, I opened up the object&rsquo;s eigenclass, and shifted up the original <code>Book</code> class. Now, the <code>charlottes_web</code> object inherits from its eigenclass, which in turn inherits from the <code>Book</code> class. The <code>Book</code> class has now become the superclass of our object.</p>

<p>Okay, that was a lot. To recap, here&rsquo;s the most important stuff to know about the mysterious eigenclass:</p>

<ol>
<li>An eigenclass is an anonymous class that is created to hold an object&rsquo;s singleton methods.</li>
<li>The anonymous eigenclass then becomes the object&rsquo;s immediate class, which it inherits from.</li>
<li>The original class is re-designated as the superclass of the anonymous eigenclass.</li>
<li>But because eigenclasses are hidden, when you call <code>charlottes_web.class</code>, it will return <code>Book</code>.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Reveal Thyself, You Eigen, You!</h2>

<p>So, eigenclasses don&rsquo;t show themselves. Cool. Except not cool. Because I want to see it! Well, you can see it, but you have to do a little extra work to make the magic happen. Actually, all you have to do is add a method available to all Ruby <code>Object</code>s, like this:</p>

<p>We open up the eigenclass of the object when we use the <code>class &lt;&lt; self</code> syntax. And once we open it up, we are in the scope of the eigenclass. Here, <code>self</code> is now the eigenclass object (everything in Ruby is an object!), and since we are returning <code>self</code>, we will get to see what the eigenclass actually looks like:</p>

<p>Interesting. So, the eigenclass of our <code>charlottes_web</code> object does look pretty anonymous, and you might not even notice its weirdness at first. But, it does clearly seem to be a <code>Class</code> object and, as we expected, was inserted into the method lookup chain right between the object and the <code>Book</code> class.</p>

<p>But if you look at the last two lines and their value, that&rsquo;s where stuff gets really interesting. The <code>wilbur</code> method, which we defined on a particular instance of an object, is a singleton method on only that object. The <code>type</code> method, however, lives in the <em>eigenclass</em> of that object.</p>

<p>Is it all coming together now? While the <code>wilbur</code> method could only be called on an instance, the <code>type</code> method can be called on an entire class. So, perhaps you&rsquo;re not not technically creating a class method, but more of an &ldquo;eigenclass class method&rdquo;. In fact, there actually is no such thing as a &ldquo;class method&rdquo; &ndash; you&rsquo;re actually inside of the eigenclass when you create that. But effectively, it&rsquo;s the same thing, because you can&rsquo;t see an eigenclass and it still inherits all the methods from a basic <code>Class</code> object.</p>

<h2>WAT</h2>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/i9nkolRQgbN9C" width="480" height="362" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p><br></p>

<p>If all of this was Greek to you, don&rsquo;t worry. This is just honestly really hard stuff. At the end of the day, all you <em>really</em> need to know is that <code>class &lt;&lt; self</code> is just another way of defining a class method. That and, <em>everything</em> in Ruby is an object.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of debate about whether or not using the <code>class &lt;&lt; self</code> syntax is helpful or just confusing. Personally, I like to use it when I have a lot of class methods to define. It can keep your code clean and easy to read, and helps you avoid typing out <code>self.method</code> multiple times.</p>

<p>But, if DRYing out your code is more confusing to you than helpful, you should probably avoid it. It&rsquo;s more about personal preference than anything else. Find a style that works for you and try not to think too much about all the crazy anonymous classes spinning around your head. Try being the keyword here.</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Technically speaking, there&rsquo;s actually no such thing as a <em>class method</em> in Ruby. You&rsquo;re always opening up the eigenclass/singleton class of an object whenever you define a class method. Keep in mind that there are many different syntaxes you can use in order to achieve this!</li>

<p>No matter where you&rsquo;re from, what programming language you prefer, or which JavaScript framework you&rsquo;re committed to, I think you&rsquo;ll agree with me on one thing: time is a bitch. And no, I don&rsquo;t mean the wrinkles on your forehead kind of time (although that sucks too); I&rsquo;m talking about time as a programming concept.</p>

<p>I mean, you create some migrations, build some models, make some API calls, but then time shows up and brings down the party. I happened to learn all about programming&rsquo;s royal pain in the ass while working with the <a href="http://instagram.com/developer/">Instagram API</a> last week. After I finally got my code working, I took a look at my JSON response and saw this strange creature:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>"created_time": "1423694433"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t know what that was either. So I went down the rabbit hole and learned about all the different things there are to know about dealing with time in your Rails applications. So save yourself some time (HAHA get it, get it?) and get the lowdown below.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>In The Beginning, It Was&hellip;1970?</h2>

<p>Okay, so you know that weird JSON response I got? The one that looked like this crazysauce: <code>"1423694433"</code>.</p>

<p>Well, believe it or not, that&rsquo;s not just a random number &ndash; it&rsquo;s a representation of time. When I first saw this in my API reponse, I knew that this definitely was neither a typical Ruby <code>Time</code> object, nor something I&rsquo;d ever seen in any of the databases of my Rails applications (which usually uses the <code>datetime</code> format).</p>

<p>So, I asked the interwebz for help. It turns out that this format is something called <strong>Unix time</strong> (also sometimes referred to as POSIX time or Epoch time). Unix time is short for the &ldquo;Unix Epoch&rdquo;, which is what we refer to when we use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time formats</a>. Basically what you need to know is this: when the first computer turned on at 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on Thursday, January 1st, 1970, time officially began. I mean, time just <em>started</em>. The computer turned on and BOOM! It just started counting.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever played around in irb, you&rsquo;ve probably used this method to figure out what time it is:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>♥ irb
</span><span class='line'>2.1.2 :001 &gt; Time.now
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; 2015-02-16 18:29:23 -0500</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But that&rsquo;s just one format of dealing with time. Want to know what time it is in the Unix Epoch? Simply apply the ever-handy <code>to_i</code> method:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>2.1.2 :002 &gt; Time.now.to_i
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; 1424129416 </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And what if you want to convert a Unix timestamp (like the one in my JSON response) back to a Ruby <code>Time</code> object? Just use the <code>Time.at</code> method:</p>

<p>Okay, okay &ndash; but what about all the stuff that happened before 1970? How do we account for that? I&rsquo;ll tell you how: NEGATIVE. NUMBERS.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Pretty sweet, right? Don&rsquo;t worry; I&rsquo;m about to complicate it a bit further.</p>

<h2>Even More Types of Time</h2>

<p>Another very common format for handling Time is ISO8601. There have been a lot of arguments <a href="http://japhr.blogspot.com/2009/01/iso-8601-is-only-date-format.html">in favor of ISO8601</a>, its YYYY-MM-DD formatting being one of the foremost reasons for that debate. The ISO8601 format is also supported by various libraries, and can be sorted easily, which makes it the ideal candidate for your database.</p>

<p>An important thing to remember about using ISO8601 is that it&rsquo;s part of the Ruby Standard Library, which means you must require it. (If you missed my explanation on the difference between the Ruby Standard Library and the Core Library, head over to <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/02/10/money-makes-the-world-go-round-using-money-rails-and-bigdecimal/">last week&rsquo;s post</a> to catch up.)</p>

<p>But if we play with ISO8601 in irb, you&rsquo;ll notice something kind of strange:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>2.1.2 :004 &gt; require 'time'
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; true 
</span><span class='line'>2.1.2 :005 &gt; Time.now.iso8601
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "2015-02-16T19:09:38-05:00" 
</span><span class='line'>2.1.2 :006 &gt; Time.now.utc.iso8601
</span><span class='line'> =&gt; "2015-02-17T00:09:34Z" </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>See that <code>Z</code> at the end of the string? That&rsquo;s how the <code>UTC</code> time zone is represented in ISO8601, with the <code>Z</code> short for &ldquo;Zero&rdquo; time. It&rsquo;s also worth reminding ourselves that Unix timestamps are also set in the <code>UTC</code> time zone.</p>

<h2>Goddamn Time Zones</h2>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/CsV1pnR9hYLuM" width="480" height="269" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>Look man, I&rsquo;m not gonna lie to you: time zones will jack your shit up. Time zone bugs are <em>so</em> common, it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re just waiting there patiently, hoping that you&rsquo;ll make a mistake.</p>

<p>But you&rsquo;re a Rails developer &ndash; ain&rsquo;t no time zone gonna stop you! Instead, you&rsquo;re going to make your code defensive and subscribe to these best practices:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Set your time zone in the <code>config/application.rb</code> file in your Rails app. Look for <code>config.time_zone</code>, and configure your time zone equal to that value. Rails will refer to that as your base time zone going forward, and ActiveRecord will convert between `UTC and your set time zone whenever you query.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the <code>in_time_zone</code> method to convert <code>Time</code> to your system&rsquo;s current set time zone. For example, <code>Time.now.in_time_zone("EST").iso8601</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code>Time.current</code> whenever you make an ActiveRecord query (ActiveRecord will convert <code>Time.current</code> and convert it to <code>UTC</code>: <code>Comment.where(["comments.published_at &gt; ?", Time.current])</code></p></li>
<li><p>DO NOT use <code>Time.now</code>! This returns <em>your</em> system&rsquo;s time, and ignores whatever time zone you configured for your Rails app. Instead, use numerical attributes and methods (such as <code>1.day.from_now</code> or <code>Date.current</code>), which rely on the time zone you configured in your <code>application.rb</code> to determine the return value.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>There are a lot of loopholes when it comes to dealing with Time zones. You can read more about them on <a href="http://www.elabs.se/blog/36-working-with-time-zones-in-ruby-on-rails">this super helpful post</a>.</p>

<h2>Time: Annoying, But Also&hellip;Awesome?</h2>

<p>Ok, don&rsquo;t get me wrong &ndash; time makes our lives miserable as developers. But it also presents some pretty epic challenges, which also makes our jobs interesting! (Look, I&rsquo;m trying to point out the silver lining here.)</p>

<p>For example, <strong>leap seconds</strong>. Yes, really &ndash; it&rsquo;s a thing. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second">Leap seconds</a> occur 1-2 times a year, on either June 30 and/or December 31st. They&rsquo;re necessary in order to keep the Earth&rsquo;s time of day close enough to the Sun&rsquo;s mean time. But, how do you account for this in programs? Well, Google actually does something pretty cool: instead of adding one second, Google&rsquo;s servers implement &ldquo;leap smears&rdquo;, which extend the seconds surrounding a leap second by just a little bit &ndash; enough to account for an entire extra second! Side note: the next leap second is on June 30th of this year! I hope you&rsquo;re ready.</p>

<p>Another bizarre thing is <strong>Y2038</strong>. If this sounds reminiscent of Y2K, that&rsquo;s because it is. Essentially, <a href="http://www.y2038.com/">the 2038 problem</a> boils down to this: On January 19, 2038, Unix timestamps will stop working because of a 32-bit overflow. So, all of the millions of applications that use this time format will have to either reconfigure to 64-bit systems, or choose a new format to store dates and times. There&rsquo;s supposedly no universal solution to this, but hopefully someone will figure out a fix in the next 22 years.</p>

<p>Hopefully by that point, someone will have figured out how to get rid of time zones completely.</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Unix timestamps and ISO8601 are both good formats for storing date and time in your database. Do a little research to decide <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15554586/timestamps-iso8601-vs-unix-timestamp">which of these formats</a> is the best tool for whatever job you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish.</li>
<li>Dealing with time zones is hard, but the <a href="http://danilenko.org/2012/7/6/rails_timezones/">Exhaustive Guide to Rails Time Zones</a> will save you hours of banging your head against the wall &ndash; well, for time-related things, at least.</li>
<li>Want to be a <code>Time</code> object superstar? Read <a href="https://unix4lyfe.org/time/?v=1">this post</a>, which was featured on HackerNews, and peruse the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org//core-2.2.0/Time.html">Ruby documentation</a> to get the skinny on all things time-related.</li>

    <id>http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/02/10/money-makes-the-world-go-round-using-money-rails-and-bigdecimal</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/webdr02/2013/3/26/12/enhanced-buzz-19756-1364314697-15.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<p>Mo money, mo problems. This is especially the case when you&rsquo;re a new developer trying to onboard onto a huge eCommerce Rails application.</p>

<p>No, but really - money is such a pain in the ass to deal with as a programmer. So much logic and detail goes into accepting a payment, processing a transaction, checking an order&rsquo;s status&hellip;and don&rsquo;t even get me <em>started</em> on shipping &ndash; seriously, I&rsquo;m saving the entire concept of shipping for another blog post.</p>

<p>But, at some point or another, you have to deal with other people&rsquo;s money. And you have to try and not screw it up, because apparently people really don&rsquo;t like that. So, how do you handle all those dolla dolla bills? Yup, you guessed it: with the <strong>money-rails library</strong> and Ruby&rsquo;s <strong>BigDecimal object</strong>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Get Dat Dough: Implementing Money-Rails</h2>

<p>Including the money-rails library is fairly simple: add <code>gem 'money-rails'</code> to your Gemfile and then <code>bundle</code> in your console.</p>

<p>But what exactly <em>is</em> this library, and how do you effectively use it? Well, that&rsquo;s another thing entirely.</p>

<p>The most important thing to note is that the <code>money-rails</code> library provides integration of the <code>money</code> gem for Rails applications. So, before you go around throwing about your dough every which way, here are a few things about the <code>money</code> gem to keep in mind:</p>

<ol>
<li>It gives you a <code>Money</code> class, and instances of this class (<code>Money</code> objects) contain all the information about a certain <em>amount</em> of money.  Provides a Money class which encapsulates all information about an certain amount of money, such as its value and its currency.</li>
<li>It provides you with a <code>Money::Currency</code> class, which contains all the information about a certain monetary unit. Instances of this class are how we will represent different currencies.</li>
<li>It includes APIs to exchange one kind of currency into another.</li>
<li>It represents money in <code>Integer</code> values, not <code>Float</code>, in order to avoid rounding errors.</li>
</ol>


<p>This last one is important, so try to remember it &ndash; we&rsquo;re going to come back to this in a bit.</p>

<h2>Make It Rain!</h2>

<p>Ok, time to get rich: let&rsquo;s make ourselves some money. Instantiating a <code>Money</code> object isn&rsquo;t too hard; simply create a new instance and pass it an amount and a currency:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">five_bucks</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Money</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">500</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;USD&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1">#=&gt; $5.00 USD</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">five_bucks</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cents</span>     <span class="c1">#=&gt; 500</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">five_bucks</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">currency</span>  <span class="c1">#=&gt; Currency.new(&quot;USD&quot;)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Notice that the amount must be passed in as cents, while the currency must be passed in as either a <code>String</code> or a <code>Money::Currency</code> object.</p>

<p>Money usually means math, so let&rsquo;s do some:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">my_money</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Money</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;USD&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">your_money</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Money</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1500</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;USD&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">my_money</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">your_money</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="no">Money</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4500</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;USD&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can also use the <code>parse</code> method, which takes in a symbol and number in a string format, and returns a <code>Money</code> object with the correct currency type:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Money</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">parse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;£60&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="no">Money</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">60</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;GBP&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In addition to comparing currencies, you can create an access them as objects:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">currency</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Money</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">60</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;GBP&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">currency</span> <span class="c1">#=&gt; &quot;£60.00 GBP&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">currency</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">iso_code</span> <span class="c1">#=&gt; &quot;GBP&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">currency</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span>     <span class="c1">#=&gt; &quot;British Pound&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can access any information of a currency (which is, again, just a <code>Money</code> object), including its <code>name</code>, <code>iso_code</code>, <code>symbol</code>, and <code>delimiter</code>. And if you want to create a new currency, you&rsquo;d simply need to pass in the values as a hash into the <code>register</code> class method. There&rsquo;s also the <code>default_currency</code> class method, which does exactly what you think it does, and an <code>exchange_to</code> method, which can be super handy if you ever want to sell your products&hellip;well, basically anywhere.</p>

<p>So. You can make money now. Like, actually <em>create</em> it. Do you feel like a god yet? Okay good. Hold onto that feeling, because it&rsquo;s about to get a little more complicated.</p>

<h2>BigDecimal: Not Just Any Ol&#8217; Number</h2>

<p>When I was first playing around with this gem, I was much like you: young, naive, thoroughly amused by the fact that I could play with money in my console with (mostly) no consequences. And then I saw this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1">#&lt;BigDecimal:7fbd6eab87f8,&#39;0.8E1&#39;,9(36)&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>Um. What? Is that an association? An object? Is it even Ruby?</em></p>

<p>The answer to my questions were no, yes, and absolutely. Actually, that little guy up there is my new friend, <code>BigDecimal</code>. And by the time you finish reading this post, I think you&rsquo;re going to like him, too.</p>

<p>Okay, time for a quick exercise! Open up irb and type in: <code>1.01 - 1.00</code></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Wait&hellip;Ruby thinks that the difference between <code>1.01</code> and <code>1.00</code> is greater than <code>0.01</code>? OH SHIT. DID WE BREAK RUBY?!</p>

<p>Nope, nope we did not. But, we <em>did</em> just discover the one true flaw of Ruby <code>Float</code>, which is that they can&rsquo;t store decimals very precisely. Apparently, the reason for this</a> is that floats are stored in a binary number format, which means that there&rsquo;s a lot of conversion from binary to decimal going on under the hood.</p>

<p>This probably doesn&rsquo;t seem all that important, but here&rsquo;s the thing: people really don&rsquo;t like it when you take their money. And when you use floats, you may very well be rounding up in cases when you really shouldn&rsquo;t be, which would result in some sort of numerical error.</p>

<p>Enter our new buddy, <code>BigDecimal</code>. We can do the exact same calculation with this object, but without the arbitrary rounding! If we try it out in irb, we&rsquo;ll get the number that we were originally expecting:</p>

<p>If you remember scientific notation from middle school, then you&rsquo;ll notice what&rsquo;s going on in <code>0.1E-1</code>, and how that converts to <code>0.01</code> when we called the <code>to_f</code> method on it. This takes more time, but it is far more accurate &ndash; something that&rsquo;s pretty important when it comes to the monies.</p>

<p>Remember earlier in the post when I told you to remember that the <code>money</code> gem uses <code>Integer</code> but not <code>Float</code>? Well, it also uses <code>BigDecimal</code> objects, for the same exact reason that we just discovered on our own.</p>

<h2>What Is Standard Cannot Be Core</h2>

<p>If your first reaction to reading this post was opening up irb and trying to make your own <code>BigDecimal</code> object, then you most certainly encountered this error:</p>

<p>Before you freak out, let me assure you that I did not lie to you &ndash; <code>BigDecimal</code> most surely is a real thing. But it&rsquo;s not a core thing. What I mean by that is, <code>BigDecimal</code> is not part of the Ruby Core Library; it&rsquo;s actually part of the Ruby Standard Library.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking to yourself, <em>Whut?! Ruby has two different libraries?</em>, you&rsquo;d be right. But even though both deal with Ruby objects, there&rsquo;s a fundamental difference between the two.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/">Ruby Core Library</a> is what you use every day, including basic objects such as <code>String</code>, <code>Integer</code>, <code>Float</code>, <code>Array</code>, <code>Hash</code>, and many others. On the other hand, the objects in the <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.2.0/">Ruby Standard Library</a> may seem a little less familiar. Unlike the Core Library, objects from the Standard Library have to be explicitly required. <code>BigDecimal</code> objects are part of the Standard Library, as are <code>Abbrev</code>, <code>Logger</code>, and <code>Matrix</code> objects.</p>

<p>The Standard Library is an extension of the Ruby language. You will always have access to the Core Library, but if you want to use an object that exists outside of the Core Library, you&rsquo;ll need to specifically require it. So, if you want to play with <code>BigDecimal</code> in the console or use it in your application, you&rsquo;ll have to type this in to have access to the object: <code>require 'bigdecimal'</code>.</p>

<h2>More Bang For Your Buck</h2>

<p>When I first started reading about <code>BigDecimal</code>, I wondered why I had never run into this type of object before. How could I have missed it entirely? As a beginner, it may not sense to use this type of Ruby object at all, and it may very well slow you down. In fact, I think floats are the default object in use for a reason: they&rsquo;re much cheaper to use in memory, and can convert, lookup, and do arithmetic much faster than <code>BigDecimal</code>. Calculations on <code>BigDecimal</code> objects are much slower because they are objects, which take up <em>far</em> more space and memory. However, if you&rsquo;re actually dealing with currency values &ndash; building an ecommerce application, for example &ndash; <code>BigDecimal</code> still seems to be a clear winner to me.</p>

<p>The <code>money</code> gem and <code>money-rails</code> library provide a lot of flexibility when it comes to handling money in your application mostly because they create <code>Money</code> objects. I&rsquo;m a huge fan of object-oriented programming, and these libraries allow you to manipulate and access your currency with far more ease than if they were stored as simple integers, or even floats.</p>

<p>However, these resources are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to dealing with money in your Rails application. Another awesome library is <a href="https://github.com/RubyMoney/monetize">monetize</a>, which allows you to convert different types of Ruby objects into <code>Money</code> objects. Once you get the basic structure and namespacing of these libraries, learning about new ones will be a piece of cake. Pretty soon, you&rsquo;ll be breaking the bank with all your knowledge about using money in Rails. Maybe you&rsquo;ll even end up like this guy:</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <code>money-rails</code> library allows you to create <code>Money</code> objects, including different currencies. Ruby <code>BigDecimal</code> objects round more accurately and are more precise than <code>Float</code> objects, making them more preferable when working with money.</li>
<li>Read more about the methods available to <code>BigDecimal</code> objects in the <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.2.0/libdoc/bigdecimal/rdoc/index.html">Ruby documentation</a>, and check out all the cool stuff that the <code>money</code> gem can do over on <a href="http://rubymoney.github.io/money/">their website</a>.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NERD ALERT: I love databases. God, they&rsquo;re just <em>fantastic</em>. Few things give me as much joy as an empty whiteboard and a couple of intricate join tables that need to be sketched out. But there&rsquo;s also an art to understanding how to handle data &ndash; particularly when you have a shit ton of it.</p>

<p>The main issue people run into with data is first, how to go about storing it, and second, how to go about getting it when you actually need it! This doesn&rsquo;t sound super complicated though, right? <em>Wrong</em>. Databases grow vertically, not horizontally, and they grow hella fast. At a certain point, the way that you go about storing your data ends up <em>directly impacting</em> how you go about retrieving it!</p>

<p>Many Rubyists write different helper methods to do their querying for them. But this is Rails Land, which means that we have <del>black</del> Rails magic at our disposal. And with the advent of Rails 4.1, that magic now has a name: <strong>enum</strong>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Get Yo Enum On</h2>

<p>When Rails 4.1 was released less than a year ago, it came out with a bunch of new features. One of those was <strong>ActiveRecord enums</strong>, which essentially cut out a lot of methods and superfluous code.</p>

<p>ActiveRecord enums allow you to manipulate the attributes of an ActiveRecord object in Rails such that an attribute&rsquo;s values map to <em>integers</em> in the database (as opposed to strings), and yet can also be <em>queried by name</em>. If all this sounds kind of crazy to you, that&rsquo;s because it is! Enums are pretty cool because they have the flexibility of a string, but the speed and efficiency of an integer. You can look up values in a huge database using an integer, but you can also update and add attributes as string. Oh &ndash; you also get a bunch of methods for FREE!</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/eYieKG19ZuaR2" width="480" height="338" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p><br></p>

<p>So how does this magic work, exactly? I thought you&rsquo;d never ask!</p>

<h2>Multiple Columns?! Ain&rsquo;t Nobody Got Time For That!</h2>

<p>To demonstrate how to implement ActiveRecord enums, I&rsquo;ll continue using <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/01/27/embrace-your-inner-paranoia-use-acts-as-paranoid/">last week&rsquo;s ecommerce bookstore app</a> as my example. So, I have these <code>Book</code> objects in my store, and I want to keep track of what their status is: either <code>in stock</code>, <code>out of stock</code>, or <code>ordered</code>. For the sake of simplicity, we&rsquo;ll pretend that I&rsquo;m not a super sophisticated bookseller, so I don&rsquo;t have a lot of <code>Book</code>s, and therefore each <code>Book</code> object can only ever have one of these three states.</p>

<p>I might first start off by having three different columns to represent each of these states:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">AddStatusesToBooks</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Migration</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">change</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">add_column</span> <span class="ss">:books</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:in_stock?</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:boolean</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">add_column</span> <span class="ss">:books</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:out_of_stock?</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:boolean</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">add_column</span> <span class="ss">:books</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:ordered?</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:boolean</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But this seems kind of&hellip;ridiculous. I&rsquo;m always going to have <em>two empty columns</em>. This code has me all like:</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/zrdUjl6N99nLq" width="480" height="380" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p><br></p>

<p>Alternatively, I could combine all of these columns into one and use some helper methods that return boolean values when I call them on an instance of a <code>Book</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Book</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">in_stock?</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">status</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">&#39;in stock&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">out_of_stock?</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">status</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">&#39;out of stock&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">ordered?</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">status</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">&#39;ordered&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Well, now I have one column, so that&rsquo;s better. But this is still so repetitive, ugly, and inefficient. Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s about to get real good.</p>

<h2>Query Your Little Heart Out</h2>

<p>Implementing enum is pretty simple. First, add the macro to your class:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Book</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">enum</span> <span class="ss">status</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:in_stock</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:out_of_stock</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:ordered</span><span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that I have my <code>status</code> attribute categorized into my three different options. The fact that they look like symbols in an array is no mistake &ndash; each of these symbols is actually associated with its index. So <code>in_stock</code> will be referenced by its index number <code>0</code>, <code>out_of_stock</code> by <code>1</code>, and <code>ordered</code> by <code>2</code>.</p>

<p>Next, add a column to your migration that will allow ActiveRecord enum to carry out your queries:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">AddStatusToBooks</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Migration</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">change</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">add_column</span> <span class="ss">:books</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:status</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:integer</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">default</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I want all my <code>Book</code> objects to default to an <code>in_stock</code> status when they are created, so I added a <code>default: 0</code> to my column. Adding a default is always a good way to keep your code defensive.</p>

<p>Now if I want to create a <code>Book</code> object and check its status:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">book</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Book</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">book</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">status</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># =&gt; &quot;in_stock&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">book</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">out_of_stock?</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># =&gt; false</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">book</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">status</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="ss">:ordered</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">book</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ordered!</span> <span class="c1">#updates the object</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">book</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ordered?</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># =&gt; true</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">book</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">status?</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># =&gt; &quot;ordered&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">book</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">out_of_stock</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># =&gt; #&lt;ActiveRecord::Relation []&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Go ahead and scroll up if you don&rsquo;t believe me &ndash; I promise I didn&rsquo;t make any of these methods! Enum gave them to me, FO FREE. So what&rsquo;s actually going on here? Well, not much more than ActiveRecord mapping the integer corresponding to the indexes of the symbols we provided in the enum macro array.</p>

<p>Our database has only one column storing all this information: <code>status</code>. That column has rows that are all either <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, or <code>3</code>. ActiveRecord pulls the actual symbols that correspond to these array indexes, and returns them, simultaneously creating an <code>in_stock</code>, <code>out_of_stock</code>, and <code>ordered</code> scope. And the icing on the cake: all the helper methods that are immediately generated for us in the process!</p>

<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>

<p>Enums give you a lot of flexibility. For example, I played around with the <code>in_stock</code> scope of my <code>Book</code> object to create a specific class method that would order the top three newest books added to my inventory:
<code>scope :newest_stock, -&gt; (limit: 3) { in_stock.order('date DESC').limit(limit) }</code></p>

<p>Another thing to remember is that you <em>cannot</em> use the same names for different enums of the same class:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Book</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">enum</span> <span class="ss">status</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">[</span> <span class="ss">:ordered</span> <span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">enum</span> <span class="ss">inventory</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">[</span> <span class="ss">:ordered</span> <span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Definitely <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> do this &ndash; this will raise an ActiveRecord error!</p>

<p>A huge upside to using enums is their contribution to your application&rsquo;s speed and performance. It&rsquo;s a <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/storage-requirements.html">well-known fact</a> that it&rsquo;s much cheaper to store data as an integer in memory, rather than as a string value. Enums take advantage of that, yet allow you to use all the ActiveRecord methods you know and love.</p>

<p>So, you can have your human-readable and fun-to-program code without sacrificing any of the speed and performance that you need to save and access your information. I guess dreams really do come true.</p>

    <id>http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/01/27/embrace-your-inner-paranoia-use-acts-as-paranoid</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I started my very first job as a software engineer! It&rsquo;s been super exciting, slightly terrifying, and sometimes overwhelming. I think one of the trickiest parts of starting as a new engineer at a company is the onboarding process.</p>

<p>It might seem kind of scary, but if you think about it, it&rsquo;s actually pretty fun. You get to dive down a rabbit hole and look at production code that you didn&rsquo;t write. It&rsquo;s getting a new puzzle that you haven&rsquo;t solved yet: you try to figure out how one thing connects to another, where modules and methods exist, how things are namespaced, not to mention learning about new frameworks and gems. I feel like I&rsquo;m entering into new dimensions and travelling through a space-time continuum or something. This also might be attributed to the fact that I&rsquo;ve been listening exclusively to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOWSTtXxf9s">Interstellar soundtrack</a> for the past two days, but whatever &ndash; you get the point.</p>

<p>My favorite part of the onboarding process is how much I&rsquo;ve been learning. Every new class or module definition brings a new piece of the puzzle that I&rsquo;ve never seen before, but can&rsquo;t wait to learn about. It&rsquo;s kind of crazy that I get paid to read and learn all day, every day &ndash; that&rsquo;s the dream, right?</p>

<p>Anyways, all of this is to say that I&rsquo;ve found and learned about some cool stuff! For example this little ditty: <code>acts_as_paranoid</code>. I saw this in a class definition and my first thought was literally: <em>Damn, that&rsquo;s a great name for a validation!</em> But as it turns out, it&rsquo;s not actually a validation &ndash; it&rsquo;s Rails magic!</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Start acting paranoid!</h2>

<p>Okay, I lied: <code>acts_as_paranoid</code> not actually <em>magic</em> &ndash; it&rsquo;s a Rails ActiveRecord plugin. But it&rsquo;s still pretty magical, you guys! So, what does it do? Well, it helps you be less paranoid about deleting stuff by accident (hence the name). Essentially, <code>acts_as_paranoid</code> allows you to make soft deletes in Rails. That means that it gives you the flexibility to delete an object without actually deleting it from the database.</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/VpbctjT9VrALS" width="480" height="260" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p><br></p>

<p>Does this sound like black magic yet? Just wait, you&rsquo;re about to see some real magic.</p>

<h2>So&hellip;how do I starting acting paranoid?</h2>

<p>In my example, I&rsquo;ll be implementing <code>acts_as_paranoid</code> on some <code>Book</code> objects in my eCommerce bookstore app. Using <code>acts_as_paranoid</code> is relatively simple. You can break it down into two simple steps:</p>

<p>First, add <code>acts_as_paranoid</code> to your class definition:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Book</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">acts_as_paranoid</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then, add a column to the database for that class called <code>deleted_at</code>, which is set to a <code>datetime</code> format:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">AddDatetimeToBooks</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Migration</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">change</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">add_column</span> <span class="ss">:books</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:deleted_at</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:datetime</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Ok, I&rsquo;m getting paranoid now &ndash; how does this work?</h2>

<p>So, we have another column in our <code>Books</code> table that has a <code>deleted_at</code> column with a type of <code>:datetime</code>. Now, this is where the magic happens: the <code>acts_as_paranoid</code> plugin actually <em>overrides</em> ActiveRecord&rsquo;s <code>find</code>, <code>count</code>, and <code>destroy</code> methods. So now when we call the <code>destroy</code> method on a <code>Book</code> object, instead of actually deleting the object, the object&rsquo;s <code>deleted_at</code> field will be set to the current date and time.</p>

<p>And, if we call the <code>find</code> method on all of our <code>Book</code> objects, the one we just &ldquo;deleted&rdquo; won&rsquo;t show up! Instead, only the objects that <em>don&rsquo;t</em> have a value in their <code>deleted_at</code> column will render.</p>

<p>So, calling <code>@book.destroy</code> doesn&rsquo;t delete a row from the database; it actually just updates the row by giving a datetime to the object&rsquo;s <code>deleted_at</code> field. If you&rsquo;re into SQL queries, this is what&rsquo;s going on:</p>

<p><code>UPDATE books SET deleted_at = '2015-01-27 19:36:16' WHERE (id = 50)</code></p>

<p>The <code>Book</code> object with an id of <code>50</code> isn&rsquo;t <em>actually</em> deleted from the database, even though it will appear so in all of our views, and to our users/admins.</p>

<h2>But who needs soft deletes, anyways?</h2>

<p>I actually didn&rsquo;t realize the use case for soft deletes at first. But it turns out that they are incredibly helpful when building out large, more complicated Rails applications.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that Ruby is an object-oriented programming language. Any object that has an association with another object inherently relies upon it. In my bookstore app example, a <code>Book</code> object would belong to a <code>Order</code> object, and also be associated with a <code>User</code> object of some sort. If you think about the appliation on a broader, less granular level, you might realize that deleting any given <code>Book</code> object could actually have serious repercussions.</p>

<p>For example, you might want to see a <code>Book</code> object that was ordered in the past, even if that <code>Book</code> has since been deleted from a store. Perhaps you want to view the details of a <code>Shipment</code> object, even if that shipment was cancelled. Or, you might want to see an order that was placed by a <code>User</code> who may have deactivated their account months ago.</p>

<p>The <code>acts_as_paranoid</code> plugin helps you access all of this information, without keeping you up at night, wondering whether you deleted the wrong row from the database. Because honestly, who has time for that? Not this kitty, for sure:</p>

<p><img src="https://idp05.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/paranoid-cat.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <code>acts_as_paranoid</code> plugin modifies ActiveRecord methods and allows you to implement soft deletes on your Ruby objects. Just remember to include it in your class definition and add a <code>deleted_at</code> column to your migration, with a type of <code>datetime</code>.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are a lot of scary things out there. To start, there are lions and tigers and bears. But if you go a bit below the surface, that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll hit the dark stuff &ndash; the kind of stuff that I was forced to confront when I started as a student at <a href="http://www.flatironschool.com">The Flatiron School</a>.</p>

<p>Sure, learning how to program is really hard &ndash; it&rsquo;s not just learning another language, it&rsquo;s learning an entirely new way to think. But, working on code is far easier than working on yourself. My twelve weeks at The Flatiron School pushed me to deal with some tough thoughts, most of which had always lurked in the skeleton closets of my mind: <em>I don&rsquo;t know if I can do this. I&rsquo;m not cut out for this. I&rsquo;m not prepared. I&rsquo;m not smart enough. I won&rsquo;t fit in. I can&rsquo;t undersand. I won&rsquo;t understand.</em></p>

<p>Most of us have all had these thoughts at some point in our lives, regardless of what we look like or what we do for a living. Some of us have stopped dead in our tracks, sometimes unable to move beyond them at all. But learning to code meant dealing with these fears on a daily basis; at some point, I just stopped listening to them entirely.</p>

<h2>The Fog Creek Fellowship</h2>

<p>Before I learned to code, I was a writer and a teacher. In other words, I had no background in computer science or software developement. Now, it&rsquo;s already pretty terrifying to enter a new field in which you have no experience. But it gets <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/09/10/2599491/women-stem/">even more frightening</a> when you realize that only 25% of the industry is female and that 71% of your coworkers are white. All these facts combined can be fairly paralyzing &ndash; it&rsquo;s no wonder, then, that so many women and minorities choose not to enter STEM fields.</p>

<p>After graduating from Flatiron, I found myself facing an entirely new sea of questions: <em>Am I prepared for all these technical interviews? How do I negotiate a salary? What offer should I accept? What&rsquo;s the best job for me? Do I want to be the only woman in an all-male tech team?</em> Luckily, I didn&rsquo;t have to swim through this alone. Instead, I had a support system gliding along beside me the entire way: <a href="http://blog.fogcreek.com/announcing-the-fog-creek-fellowship/">The Fog Creek Fellowship</a>.</p>

<p>Forged through a partnership with the Flatiron School, the fellowship is dedicated to creating a more diverse and welcoming tech community by nurturing a select group of female Flatiron graduates as they look for their first programming jobs. Fellows are paired with a Fog Creek, Trello, or StackExchange developer &ndash; who just so happen to be some of the best coders in the country &ndash; and have the opportunity to create long-lasting relationships through pair programming sessions, interview prep, and technical talks.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en"><p>Class two began today! <a href="http://t.co/LUaRwAnLUW">http://t.co/LUaRwAnLUW</a> &amp; the list of additional companies getting involved is so inspiring! <a href="http://t.co/hFaCy5HUlg">pic.twitter.com/hFaCy5HUlg</a></p>&mdash; Elizabeth Hall (@Liz_Hall1) <a href="https://twitter.com/Liz_Hall1/status/552204196016312320">January 5, 2015</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<h2>Fearlessness</h2>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect when I started the fellowship. Thankfully, my <a href="https://twitter.com/ianthehenry">phenomenal mentor Ian</a> was full of ideas. Thinking back on it now, I realize that all of our mentors helped us to confront the things that we were the most uncomfortable (read: afraid) of.</p>

<p>A lot of us didn&rsquo;t understand a lot of the computer science concepts that were coming up in technical interviews, so the mentors took the time to review tougher technical topics, and encouraged us to always speak up if ever we were confused.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en"><p>Trello devs taking a break from making <a href="https://twitter.com/trello">@trello</a> awesome to help some <a href="https://twitter.com/FlatironSchool">@FlatironSchool</a> devs be more awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fogcreek?src=hash">#fogcreek</a> <a href="http://t.co/bS2iTQfpRm">pic.twitter.com/bS2iTQfpRm</a></p>&mdash; Michael Pryor (@michaelpryor) <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelpryor/status/555807419214102528">January 15, 2015</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p><br></p>

<p>I always wanted to learn more about Objective C and iOS, so my mentor and I built a simple iPhone app that implemented the New York Times API and showed the top stories of the day. It was undoubtedly hard, but everything that&rsquo;s new and different always is. Ian helped me face my doubts head on, and nudged me to be unafraid of making mistakes or being wrong.</p>

<p>All the mentors and mentees hung out together, ate lunch, and talked tech and non-tech topics. And when I was trying to choose between a few different offers, they helped me talk through what I wanted out of my job, and which position would make me happy. We talked about everything from what we wanted our careers to look like in five years, to the pipeline problem for women in tech.</p>

<h2>Fortitude</h2>

<p>It takes a great deal of grit and strength of mind to endure and accept obstacles that come your way. To be a woman in technology, you need ample amounts of fortitude. There&rsquo;s really no other way to put it: <a href="http://www.payscale.com/career-news/2014/12/what-it's-really-like-for-women-in-tech">it&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-leadership/wp/2015/01/20/the-women-who-make-it-in-tech/">hard</a> to be a <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2015/commentary-bring-binders-full-women-tech-must-get-page/">woman</a> in <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/09/10/2599491/women-stem/">tech</a>. It&rsquo;s hard to be <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/20/7856467/airbnb-diversity-report-gender-race-interactive-chart">a person of color</a> in tech. But the only way that we can begin to change the reality of the situation is by bringing in more women and minorities into the industry.</p>

<p>Granted, the solution to the problem might come in different shades for various people. Whether that means creating relationships based on trust and openness (such as the ones that we had with our mentors), or providing the resources to build confidence (like technical talks or interview prep), they&rsquo;re all steps in the right direction. If enough people follow suit, the industry will soon have an entirely new generation of developers and engineers, each of whom will pay it forward.</p>

<p>From my own personal experience at Fog Creek Software, I can definitely vouch for the simplicity of a safe, welcoming space for women. If you&rsquo;re wondering how you can change the industry, I&rsquo;d say that this is a good way to start. I suppose that it&rsquo;s a simple thing, really, but it makes a world of difference. Both Fog Creek and the Flatiron School are communities that acknowledge a problem and then proceed to create an environment that mirrors a world that we want to one day live in.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d consider myself one of the lucky few who has been a part of this incremental change. The Flatiron School and the Fog Creek Fellowship opened so many doors for me &ndash; doors that I know I could have never opened on my own. As I take my first step and start a new job as a developer, I&rsquo;m realizing that the fellowship isn&rsquo;t really over. It&rsquo;s just that my role in it is changing. Soon, it&rsquo;ll be my turn to help open the very same doors for someone else.</p>

<p>Hopefully, she&rsquo;ll be even more fearless than me.</p>

    <link href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/01/20/implementing-rem-in-css-or-how-to-be-a-shiny-happy-developer/"/>
    <updated>2015-01-20T17:39:10-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/01/20/implementing-rem-in-css-or-how-to-be-a-shiny-happy-developer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During a recent pair programming session, I came to the tough realization that I really know <em>nothing</em> about CSS. Granted, I can add in a <code>div</code> tag here and there, and yes, I can make a responsive page using Twitter Bootstrap like no one&rsquo;s business. But, what do I really know about design? Not as much as I thought I did.</p>

<p>I figured out that this was the case when the designer I was pairing with started using <strong>ems</strong> and <strong>rems</strong>. I should probably preface this and say that I have always been a pixel kind of girl. I was formerly of the mindset that you can have any font size you like &ndash;  as long as it&rsquo;s defined in pixels.</p>

<p>But, after doing a bit of research, I found that ems and rems actually have an interesting history behind them, and are super helpful when it comes to elastic layouts and responsive design.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>wait. there are different types of layouts?</h2>

<p>Yes! Trying to make your web applications responsive can be a nightmare, and kind of feels like this:</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/13FrpeVH09Zrb2" width="480" height="462" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p><br></p>

<p>Designers have long debated <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/02/fixed-vs-fluid-vs-elastic-layout-whats-the-right-one-for-you/">what kind of page layouts</a> are the best solution for this problem. The most interesting one is the elastic layout, which combines fluid and fixed layouts, and relies completely on sizing all the elements on a page by using <strong>ems</strong>. This is a pretty popular layout amongst designers and developers alike because, when it&rsquo;s properly implemented, the entire page grows or shrinks in proportion with the user&rsquo;s window size.</p>

<p>By now, you&rsquo;re probably thinking to yourself, <em>Okay, that&rsquo;s all great, but dear lord please tell me what ems and rems are!</em></p>

<p>Well, your wish is my command.</p>

<h2>Getting down with ems</h2>

<p>An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_%28typography%29"><em>em</em></a> is nothing more than a unit of measurement. Ems have actually been around for awhile and date back to the early days of typography. The em was originally a point of reference to the width of the metal block used to make a capital &ldquo;M&rdquo; in any particular size of typeface.</p>

<p>But for our purposes, we only need to think about ems in the context of CSS, which is a vertical measurement. <a href="http://v1.jontangerine.com/log/2007/09/the-incredible-em-and-elastic-layouts-with-css">Jon Tan</a>, designer and typographer extrordinaire, describes em units pretty clearly:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One em equals the vertical space needed for any given letter in a font, regardless of the horizontal space it occupies. Therefore:<br> If the font size is 16px, then 1em = 16px.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Protip: most popular web browsers have a default font size of 16 pixels. So, if you wanted to have a font size that was half that size, or 8 pixels, you could specify that in ems as &ldquo;0.5em&rdquo; (in other words, 50% of the original font size).</p>

<h2>But do i really need to use &lsquo;em?</h2>

<p>You don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to use ems. Case in point: I&rsquo;d never used them until a week ago. But using them can save you lines of code. The most important thing to remember about ems is how they are different from pixels: <strong>ems are relative, pixels are not.</strong> This is especially helpful when you have nested elements.</p>

<p>Imagine you have a file that needs to have four different font sizes:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nc">.regular_font</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-size</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">14px</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nc">.big_font</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-size</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">28px</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nc">.med_font</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-size</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">21px</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nc">.small_font</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-size</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">7px</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>regular_font</code> class is the parent type, from which the three other classes will inherit. This code is perfectly fine, but imagine that you need six different font sizes or, for a larger app, ten or twenty. And what if you decided at the last minute that you wanted to make the parent element 16px, rather than 14px? Since pixel values don&rsquo;t inherit, you&rsquo;d have to go back and change <em>every single font size</em> to make all the styling to scale. No bueno, amirite?</p>

<p>The same styling could be rewritten using ems, like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nc">.regular_font</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-size</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">1.0em</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nc">.big_font</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-size</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">2.0em</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nc">.med_font</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-size</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">1.5em</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nc">.small_font</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-size</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">0.5em</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>All of the font sizes now inherit from their parent element, which means that they will scale (think perecentages) depending on the size of the parent element. If you wanted to change the styling of all these font sizes, you&rsquo;d only actually have to change the parent element. Muy bueno, si?</p>

<h2>Okay, Okay &ndash; but what&rsquo;s this rem nonsense?</h2>

<p>Rems are almost the same as ems, except that there&rsquo;s no parent element that&rsquo;s defined. Instead, all the font sizes are based on the root <code>html</code> element. Don&rsquo;t freak out &ndash; all this really means is that you define a font size on the html element, and then all other elements will scale in font size relative to that.</p>

<p>In this example, the <code>.small_font</code> class inherits directly from the <code>html</code> parent element:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">html</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-size</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">1.0em</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nc">.small_font</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-size</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="m">5</span><span class="n">rem</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>But, but&hellip;I&rsquo;m really bad at math!</h2>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry: there&rsquo;s an app for that. More specifically, a website that helps you calculate your ems. You can head on over to <a href="http://pxtoem.com/">PXtoEm.com</a>, and play around with pixels and ems and become a styling wizard.</p>

<p>Now, GO FORTH and style away!</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/f0SFw1gXlmkc8" width="480" height="564" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Ems are relative units of measurement, and pixels are not. Rems are basically just like ems, except that they inherit from the <code>html</code> element directly.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t have to use ems, but they can be helpful. A good way to start is by using pixels in development, and then assess whether your application actually <em>needs</em> to be responsive before heading over into em territory.</li>

    <id>http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/01/13/tidying-up-those-views-using-decorators-in-rails</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, I had my first full-day technical interview. It was a thrilling experience, and so much more fun than I expected. Part of that was because I viewed the whole experience not as an evaluation, but rather an opportunity to learn as much as I could from experienced developers. I also knew that, irrespective of whether I did well or not, I&rsquo;d learn some new technologies and tricks. And boy, was that the truth.</p>

<p>I left the interview with a long list of things I&rsquo;d never heard of (<em>why hello, blog posts for the next five Tuesdays!</em>), one of which included the use of decorators in Rails. I was actually kind of surprised that I had never encountered decorators while building my own Rails apps, but it turns out that these are actually pretty advanced topics and there&rsquo;s a good amount of <a href="https://bibwild.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/the-simplest-rails-decorator-implementation-that-just-might-work/">debate on how and when to use decorators</a>, and <a href="http://thepugautomatic.com/2014/03/draper/">whether or not they&rsquo;re actually useful</a>.</p>

<p>But hey, none these discussions apply or make any sense unless you know <em>what</em> a decorator actually is. So, let&rsquo;s find out!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a well-known fact that your Rails model should be fat, and your controllers should be skinny. But what about your views? Well, there are varying schools of thought on the MVC framework and how it should function. Steve Klabnik <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2011-12-30-active-record-considered-harmful">argued that views should have no logic</a>, stating that otherwise &ldquo;They&rsquo;re hard to test, they&rsquo;re hard to read, and it&rsquo;s not just a slippery slope, but a steep one. Things go downhill rapidly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I really liked the way that John Otander described how views should function in <a href="http://johnotander.com/rails/2014/03/07/decorators-on-rails/">his blog post on decorators</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Your views should be stupid. I like to use the analogy that views should read similarly to a shopping list. There shouldn&rsquo;t be any complexity or logic.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>I decided to look back at <a href="https://flatiron-cabbie.herokuapp.com/">Cabbie</a>, one of my first projects, and check out the shape of my own views. This app basically was a review system (think Yelp) for New York City cab drivers. We had models such as Users, Drivers, Reviews, etc.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a taste of our driver show page:</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much the face I made when I looked at this code with a fresh set of eyes. This is one tiny little snippet of code, but imagine many more conditionals and much more logic in this view, and you get the idea. Not a pretty picture.</p>

<p>A couple things seemed problematic about this code:</p>

<ol>
<li>The first problem was that the view had to do the logic of figuring out whether a driver had a four-digit medallion number (NYC taxi) or a longer medallion number (an Uber driver). How could we fix this? Well, we could abstract this into a method in the class.</li>
<li>The second problem: why is it the <code>Driver</code> object&rsquo;s job to keep track of this? Do we really need a helper method in this case? All we really need this logic for is in rendering the view. We could make it its own class that inherits from the Driver class, maybe?</li>
<li>Ok, the third problem: we know what we want &ndash; a <code>Driver</code> object that has some special functionality when it comes to presenting it in the view. But how do we get it? We want to extend the behavior of the <code>Driver</code> class purely for decorative purposes. Sounds like a job for a <strong>decorator</strong>!</li>
</ol>


<p>So, what is a decorator, you might ask? Well, firstly, it&rsquo;s actually known as the <strong>decorator pattern</strong>. An aspect of object-oriented programming, decorators allow you to add functionality to an object, but also retains all the other methods that belong to that object&rsquo;s class. It&rsquo;s a great tool to use when you want to implement and/or encapsulate certain methods that are only used in the view, and yet still have access to all the other properties of that object.</p>

<p>The best way to learn what a decorator does is to try and use it yourself and see what happens. I implemented my decorator on my Cabbie app, using the <a href="https://github.com/drapergem/draper">Draper gem</a>.</p>

<p>First, you&rsquo;ll want to make sure you add <code>gem 'draper'</code> to your Gemfile.</p>

<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll want to generate the decorator for whatever object you want to &lsquo;decorate&rsquo;. In my case, I wanted to implement it on the driver object, so I typed <code>rails generate decorator Driver</code> into my terminal.</p>

<p>Then, add <code>.decorate</code> to your object in the appropriate controller. Here&rsquo;s how I did it in my <code>DriversController</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After generating your decorator, you&rsquo;ll notice that there&rsquo;s a new directory in your <code>/app</code> file called <code>decorators</code>. Nothing to be scared of here: it&rsquo;s just a class that inherits from the Draper Decorator gem. Here&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll add any additonal functionality you want your &lsquo;decorated&rsquo; object to have.</p>

<p>In my case, I wanted to abstract away the Driver&rsquo;s medallion/license number away and encapsulate it into a method. I created an <code>id_number</code> method in my decorator file:</p>

<p>Okay, you still with me? Here&rsquo;s the satisfying part. Cut out all that ridiculous erb from your view &ndash; we don&rsquo;t need that anymore! Instead, we&rsquo;ll just call on the decorator method that we wrote for exactly this purpose. Ready? Okay. Let&rsquo;s do this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="x">  </span><span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="vi">@driver</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">id_number</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>LOOK. AT. THAT. No iterations. No <code>if</code>/<code>elsif</code>/<code>end</code> keywords. One method, being called on exactly one object. No logic at all. You can read this and know exactly what we&rsquo;re trying to render. <em>Beautiful</em>.</p>

<p>As lovely as this looks, it&rsquo;s also important to keep in mind that this is an advanced topic and not always necessary. Only use decorators if they&rsquo;ll actually clean up your code and be helpful.</p>

<p>And on that note, there&rsquo;s only one thing left to do: Get tidying, kids!</p>

    <id>http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/01/06/the-final-countdown-using-javascripts-setinterval-plus-clearinterval-methods</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s a brand new year, and with that comes a renewed sense of self. Also: a rather lengthy todo list. Enter <strong>#technicaltuesdays</strong>, or my attempt at beefing up my technical chops by posting a blog post every week &mdash; specifically on Tuesdays, in case it wasn&rsquo;t obvious. (Sorry, Thursday, you were a close second, but you just didn&rsquo;t make the cut.)</p>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s on the menu this week? JavaScript! New year = new me, you guys. Actually, some of my technical interviews have been a bit JavaScript-heavy, so I&rsquo;ve been stepping up my curly bracket game.</p>

<p>In honor of the new year, I wanted to use JavaScript to create a quick &ldquo;New Year&rsquo;s Countdown&rdquo; function. Suffice it to say, <em>it was neither quick nor easy</em>. But I learned about two cool timing events in JavaScript &ndash; <strong>setInterval</strong> and <strong>clearInterval</strong> &ndash; and now you can learn about them, too!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<h2>setInterval()</h2>

<p>Okay, so what exactly was my goal with this function? I wanted to it to countdown from 10 to 1 and then print out &ldquo;Happy New Year!&rdquo;. JavaScript has a couple different time events, but the trick is figuring out which one works best for your purposes.</p>

<p>I first started off trying to use the setTimeout() method, which waits a certain amount of time before executing the function that you pass it as a parameter. I was stuck for a long time trying to figure out how to get my code to execute again after every second. I quickly realized that this method wasn&rsquo;t the best tool for the job.</p>

<p>Luckily, one method did just the trick: <strong>setInterval()</strong>. The setInterval method executes a function that you pass in as a parameter at a deteremined interval. The interval is also a parameter, and is passed in as milliseconds. <em>Protip: 1000 milliseconds = 1 second</em>. A generic setInterval method might look something like <code>setInterval(functionYouWantToRun(), 1000)</code>.</p>

<p>This was perfect for my countdown function, which needed to do the same thing &ndash; namely, count down from ten to zero &ndash; every one second.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what my function looked like in the first iteration:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">counter</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">setInterval</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(){</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">counter</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">counter</span><span class="o">--</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">counter</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;HAPPY NEW YEAR!!&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">},</span> <span class="mi">1000</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I first created a <code>counter</code> variable, which I logged to the console, and then decremented by one each time the function ran. I passed in the two parameters that setInterval requires: a function to execute (in my case, an anonymous, unnamed function), and an interval at which it should be executed (every one second). I also added a conditional to log &ldquo;Happy New Year!&rdquo; once the counter hit zero.</p>

<p>So, did it work? YES! But also, NO. This code <em>does</em> count down from 10, and prints out &ldquo;HAPPY NEW YEAR!!&rdquo; when it hits zero. But now, there was another problem: it just WOULD. NOT. STOP.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tGznKSo.gif" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<h2>Make it stop!! Or, clearInterval()</h2>

<p>The setInterval method is great and all, until you hit an infinite loop and your code runs forever and ever and ever and &ndash; you get the idea. This method on its own doesn&rsquo;t do much more than loop by default. But, when it&rsquo;s combined with its twin method <strong>clearInterval()</strong>, which &ndash; you guessed it &ndash; clears the function at a certain interval, you it can acutally be quite handy.</p>

<p>So, how does clearInterval work? Well, it takes just one parameter: the function that you want to clear. This is important for remember for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>You have to save your setInterval method to a variable</li>
<li>This variable must be accessible (in scope) by the clearInterval method</li>
</ol>


<p>A clearInterval method might look something like <code>clearInterval(func)</code>, where <code>var func = setInterval(functionYouWantToRun(), 1000)</code>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what the second iteration of my function looked like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>

<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">counter</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">counter</span><span class="o">--</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">counter</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;HAPPY NEW YEAR!!&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">clearInterval</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">newYearCountdown</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">},</span> <span class="mi">1000</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I saved my function to variable called <code>newYearCountdown</code>, and then passed that variable in as a parameter to my clearInterval method, which will only fire when the <code>counter</code> variable is set to zero. When <code>var counter</code> is set to zero, a couple things will happen:</p>

<ol>
<li>The string <code>HAPPY NEW YEAR!!</code> will be logged to the console</li>
<li>The clearInterval method will execute</li>
<li>The setInterval method will stop running</li>
</ol>


<p>And this is what will be printed out:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://xkcdsw.com/content/img/1105.gif" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<p>Recursion is kind of like the cloud &ndash; it&rsquo;s hard to explain and you might not ever see it, but it definitely is a thing. Yet we deal directly with recursion more than we may realize.</p>

<p><strong><em>Recursion</em></strong> is the process of repating a procedure or action. In Ruby, we put all of our procedures inside of a method, and we use loops to repeat those procedures again and again. So, if we have methods and loops, what&rsquo;s the need for recursion?</p>

<p>Well, as Rubyists, we&rsquo;re pretty lucky to work with a language that&rsquo;s intuitive and human-friendly. We like to read and write code that&rsquo;s actually comprehensive and (ideally) can be understood and appreciated by programmers and non-programmers alike. It turns out that recursion is a big part of that. It can make our code more readable and can even help it run faster.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Functionally Recursive Babushkas</h2>

<p>In Ruby, we use recursion when we call a method from within itself. Sometimes, when you&rsquo;re within the scope of a method, you want to repeat the same action again from inside of it. Functional recursion achieves exactly that goal.</p>

<p>One of the best metaphors for recursion that I&rsquo;ve heard comes from my friend and <a href="http://jimmykuruvilla.github.io/">fellow classmate, Jimmy</a>. He explained recursion as a set of nested Russian matryoshka (aka babushka) dolls:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.russia-ex.com/images/blog/Matryoshka-Dolls-1.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<p>These dolls work in a pretty interesting way. Within each one, there is another doll that is exactly the same. You have multiple copies of the same doll, each within another, until eventually, you get to the smallest doll.</p>

<p>In the programming context, the smallest doll is your <strong>base case</strong>. The base case is imperative when it comes to utilizing recursion. It&rsquo;s how you tell your recursive method when to <em>stop</em> calling itself from inside of itself.</p>

<p>Imagine what would happen if you didn&rsquo;t have a final doll to end with &ndash; you&rsquo;d just keep going and going and going until, eventually, your head would probably explode:</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/MrZTFRJ8F4n6" width="480" height="641" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p><br></p>

<p>Or, more likely, you&rsquo;d be stuck in something like an infinite loop, and you&rsquo;d eventually use more memory than whatever was available to you in the stack, ending up with an error like <code>SystemStackError: stack level too deep</code> or <code>Stack overflow!</code>.</p>

<p>These kinds of errors are good reminders of how dangerous recursion can be. But don&rsquo;t let that dissuade you! Recursion can also be pretty powerful, especially if you want to repeat a function multiple times.</p>

<h2>Recursion, Rinse, Repeat</h2>

<p>A classic example for explaining recursion is calculating factorials. Just in case you need a refresher: a factorial is the product of an integer and all the integers below it, up to the number 1. The factorial of 4 would be written out as: <code>4 * 3 * 2 * 1</code>, or <code>24</code>.</p>

<p>Now, we could very easily write this using a <code>while</code> loop:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">factorial</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">num</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">factorial_count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">num</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">factorial_count</span> <span class="o">*=</span> <span class="n">num</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">num</span> <span class="o">-=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">factorial_count</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But let&rsquo;s look at this code for a second. What exactly happens when our compiler runs this code? Well, a lot of stuff.</p>

<ol>
<li>First, it has to keep track of our counter, since we only ever want to calculate a factorial down to the number 1.</li>
<li>Then, it checks that the number being passed in as a parameter (for example, <code>num = 7</code>), is greater than 0.</li>
<li>If <code>num</code> is greater than 0, it will multiply <code>num</code> by the counter.</li>
<li>Then, it will decrease the counter by 1.</li>
<li>Finally, it repeats steps 1-4 again until <code>num = 0</code>, in which case it will and finally break out of the <code>while</code> loop.</li>
</ol>


<p>Okay. <strong>WHUT?!</strong> This seems like a lot of stuff to keep track of. And that <code>factorial_count</code> variable is pretty weird and counter-intuitive (pun <em>totally</em> intended). And if we were calculating the factorials for a larger numbr &ndash; say 70, instead of 7 &ndash; this would be a lot of logic to keep track of and repeat over and over.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s rethink this problem for a second. What we actually want to do is find the factorials of all the numbers smaller than 7 and greater than 1, and then just multiply them together. In fact, all we really want to do is repeat the same procedure of multiplication.</p>

<p>Instead of using a loop, we could write a method that takes in a single argument <code>num</code>, and actually use that same method to replicate the process of multiplication. That might look something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">factorial</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">num</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">include?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">num</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">num</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">factorial</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">num</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There&rsquo;s something pretty interesting happening here. If we pass in the number 7 as our parameter for <code>num</code>, our compiler does the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>First, it immediately jumps past the <code>if</code> statement.</li>
<li>Next, it multiplies 7 by <code>factorial(6)</code></li>
<li>Then, inside of the <code>factorial(6)</code> method, it circumvents the <code>if</code> statement again, and multiplies 6 by <code>factorial(5)</code>.</li>
<li>Eventually, when it hits the <code>if</code> statement, it returns 1.</li>
</ol>


<p>Here&rsquo;s a visualization of what this looks like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Does the Russian doll metaphor make a bit more sense now? Here are our seven dolls, each one nested within another. And our base case is 1, which is where our nesting and recursive function actually ends, helping us avoid a stack overflow error.</p>

<p>I think that the best part of this code, though, is that it&rsquo;s a <em>lot</em> easier to read. There&rsquo;s no counter, no loop, no incrementation. Just one clean and crisp method that you can use as many times as needed after defining it only once. And, if you think about it, the visual representation of the compiler&rsquo;s actions mimics exactly how a real human would write out and solve a factorial problem.</p>

<p>One of the most difficult aspects of programming is picking the right tool for a job. Sometimes, that tool might be recursion and make your job easier. Other times, it might be the completely wrong choice and infinitely complicate your life. But, the more that you code and get comfortable with recursion, the better you&rsquo;ll be at recognizing when to bust out the recursive wrench out of your toolbelt.</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>Recursion</em> is the process of calling a method or function from within itself.</li>
<li>Functional recursion <strong>must</strong> have a <em>base case</em> in order to avoid stack overflow errors.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Disheveled hair. Bags under your eyes. Hermit-like tendencies. Suffice it to say, project mode can do a <em>lot</em> of things to a person. It&rsquo;s the first time you&rsquo;re on your own, and the feeling of &ldquo;sink or swim&rdquo; will, inevitably, hit you in the face at some point or another.</p>

<p>But, project mode also teaches you a lot about what it means to focus and ship software. And it doesn&rsquo;t really matter that you&rsquo;ve only been coding for 9 weeks and that your application has only four models and that you&rsquo;re missing a ton of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags. Why? Because the mistakes you make in your first application are ones that you&rsquo;ll never make again. So, inspired by <a href="http://blakedeboer.ghost.io/recent-lessons-learned/">Blake&rsquo;s post on lessons learned</a> from building a web application, here are a few things I learned in the process of shipping my first piece of software:</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>1. Build something you actually care about</h2>

<p>This seems obvious, but it&rsquo;s worth repeating: don&rsquo;t choose a project or problem that you think other people would find interesting &ndash; choose something that <em>you</em> genuinely find interesting. If you aren&rsquo;t invested in the question that you&rsquo;re trying to answer, it&rsquo;s going to be evident in the product and demo. On the other hand, if you really care about what you&rsquo;re building, your passion will not only come through in your product and presentation, but will filter down and get other people excited about what you&rsquo;re building. It&rsquo;s also important to remember that <em>you</em>, more than anyone else, are going to have to look at your data and code; you might as well pick something you won&rsquo;t mind looking at for hours at a time, days on end.</p>

<h2>2. Ignore the OCD impulses, leave styling for later</h2>

<p>Possibly the biggest mistake we made while building our app was trying to make it look better before it was really done. We tried to implement some styling not only before we had picked a theme, but worse: before we actually knew what information we&rsquo;d ultimately end up displaying to our users. All in all, we probably wasted 6-10 hours collectively, all in a futile attempt to make a broken application look prettier. When the time finally came to actually style our application, a lot of time went in trying to reformulate our CSS to make it work with the theme that we chose. So, no matter how much it gnaws at you, leave the styling, design, and UX stuff until your application is fully-functional and, most importantly, <em>finished</em>.</p>

<h2>3. Set small goals &amp; short time limits</h2>

<p>One of the things that our group did quite well was building out one feature at a time and adding functionality to our application bit by bit. We did a good job of writing out and prioritizing the different kinds of functionality and types of features we could tackle in a given day. But it was much tougher to learn how much time to spend on actually building a feature out. A few days into project mode, we started setting time limits for ourselves, both individually and as a team. One person could only spend so much time working on a problem before opening it up to the group, and as a group, we could only debug a problem for so long before outsourcing to a TA or classmate. This minimized the number of hours we spent staring our screens without knowing which direction to go in next. With small, progressive goals to work towards and short spurts of time to complete them in, we were as a whole, far more productive.</p>

<h2>4. Do what you don&rsquo;t know</h2>

<p>I have this fear of routes. Correction: I <em>had</em> a fear of routes. How did I stop being scared of routing and that silly little <code>routes.rb</code> file? I forced myself to map out the routes with my group and take the lead in actually programming them out in our application.</p>

<p>While I coded, my project partner Joe (who&rsquo;s a super skilled router) helped me debug our routes, and made sure to explain why we were routing certain things in a specific way. And when we got to the CSS and styling, he took over the wheel while I helped him navigate the grid column framework in Bootstrap. This ended up being a super symbiotic relationship, because we both worked on the exact topics we knew that we were weak in, and both became better programmers in the process.</p>

<h2>5. Version control: &lsquo;Nuff said.</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re rusty on merging branches, making a commit, or merging conflicts, use project mode as an opportunity to conquer your git fears and learn as much as you can. Version control is awesome. It will probably (read: definitely) save you at some point in your project.</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Build first, design later.</li>
<li>Write code that you care about.</li>
<li>Practice what you don&rsquo;t already know.</li>
<li>For the love of God, commit yo shit!</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2014/11/19/how-programming-makes-you-a-better-writer/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-19T08:08:47-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2014/11/19/how-programming-makes-you-a-better-writer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I was in my terrible twos, my mom walked in on me writing all over the white walls of our living room with a pencil. I didn&rsquo;t even know how to write, much less <em>what</em> to write. But apparently, even as a toddler, I knew that writing was exactly what I wanted to do. (Side note: when my dad got home, he made me erase everything I&rsquo;d written. But I digress.)</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that writing has always been the medium of choice when it comes to expressing myself. So when I set aside my literary pen eight weeks ago to learn how to code at <a href="http://www.flatironschool.com/">The Flatiron School</a>, I did it with a heavy heart. I knew I&rsquo;d be learning how to build amazing things with the powerful tools that programming gives you, but I also assumed that I&rsquo;d be abandoning my one true passion.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ve learned two important things since then: first, you probably shouldn&rsquo;t assume things randomly. Second, and more seriously, writing and coding are far more similar than they are different. And I&rsquo;ve realized that coding has not only made me a better writer &ndash; it has also made me a better person.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Writing is unanimously thought of as a communicative art form, something that is unrestricted and free-flowing, which can overcome you at any given moment; and when you&rsquo;re in that moment, you have to surrender yourself to that creative genius within. Programming&rsquo;s reputation, on the other hand, is far more rigid, dependent on logic, discipline, and structure. But as someone who is now trying to inhabit both of these worlds, I can tell you that writing also depends on order and coherence just as much as programming relies on creative flow, clarity, and communication. Ultimately, writing is just as much a puzzle as programming is a narrative.</p>

<h2>Intuition</h2>

<p>Words and code both depend on intuition. As you write, you have to be honest with yourself about why you make certain creative choices: does your favorite character really add anything significant to your narrative? Is your narrator&rsquo;s voice believable? Does the reader even want to keep reading after your opening paragraph?</p>

<p>The questions that programmers ask themselves aren&rsquo;t too different. Does this method do more than one thing? Can I encapsulate and abstract this function somewhere in my code to avoid repeating myself? Does this functionality even belong in my application&rsquo;s controller? And perhaps the most important question of all: can anyone else <em>understand</em> my code?</p>

<p>Writers and programmers don&rsquo;t just have to become comfortable with their art forms: they have to truly understand every aspect of them. Programmers internalize their code and what it does in the same way that writers embody their self-created literary worlds. While at first you may not be able to put your finger on what&rsquo;s missing from a piece of writing, the more you write, the better you get at articulating what makes a piece of writing work. Similarly, as a programmer, you don&rsquo;t initially make the most educated guesses as to where a bug in your code might be, or what kinds of methods belong in a certain class. But the more you code, the better your intuition becomes, and the better you get programming.</p>

<h2>Discipline</h2>

<p>One of the best parts of programming is that you can easily get instant feedback. Write your code, and you can immediately run it and see what works and what breaks. But more often than not, your code is broken and you are constantly working to fix it. This takes a tremendous amount of discipline.</p>

<p>Computer programming forces you to constantly evaluate (and then reevaluate) your creative choices. You have to work through problems methodically, and work towards creating a framework and structure that furthers the functionality of your application. But the thing is, the programming concept of &ldquo;Make it work, make it right, make it fast,&rdquo; attributed to <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast">Kent Beck</a>, applies just as much to code in a text editor as it does to words on a page.</p>

<p>If you want to be a good writer, you have to be able to structure your stories and revisit your writing in various drafts. Strong writing is never created in the first draft; it requires a shit ton of work. Every single writer will tell you that the one of the hardest parts of their job is rewriting, editing, and then rewriting again. And just as programmers refactor their code, writers &ldquo;refactor&rdquo; their narratives, striving to eliminate superfluous words and unnecessary paragraphs. And the most prolific programmers and prophetic writers get to where they are because they are incredibly disciplined when it comes to their craft.</p>

<h2>Empathy</h2>

<p>Writers create for their readers. Programmers create for their users. Neither of them allows for complete solitude, and both of them force you to put yourself in someone else&rsquo;s shoes. Writers have to empathize with their characters in order to make them believable and reliable for their readers. Programmers have to not only think about how their users experience an application, but also the readability of their code when it comes to other developers joining a project. In both cases, there&rsquo;s very little room to be selfish.</p>

<p>You also learn to be kinder to yourself in the process. Writing and programming are equally hard, sometimes in the exact same way. In fact, all artistic endeavors are physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausting. But then again, isn&rsquo;t that supposed to be the case? You&rsquo;re creating something out of nothing &ndash; adding something to the universe that didn&rsquo;t already exist before <em>you</em> created it.</p>

<p>Code is a living, breathing piece of art. When you build and ship an application, it&rsquo;s (hopefully) consumed by users around the world, all the time. You&rsquo;re never really done creating your art. Words are not that different. You put yourself into your writing and release it out into the world, just as you&rsquo;d deploy an application, for all the world to see.</p>

<p>The idea of <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html">hackers as artists</a> isn&rsquo;t a new one. The real question is, what about them is similar &ndash; and what can we learn about the creative process to become the best writers and programmers that we can be?</p>

    <link href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2014/11/16/the-asset-whutline-revisiting-the-asset-pipeline-after-javascript/"/>

    <id>http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2014/11/16/the-asset-whutline-revisiting-the-asset-pipeline-after-javascript</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago, I was introduced to the Asset Pipeline. I didn&rsquo;t really think much of it at first, and part of me even assumed that I&rsquo;d never really have to see it again. It was a little like going out on a pretty forgettable first date &ndash; nothing particularly intriguing about the whole thing, but it somehow leaves you feeling kind of confused and generally rather perplexed.</p>

<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing: I <em>did</em> see the Asset Pipeline again. And boy was it awkward. After learning JavaScript this week and brushing up on my Rails, I realized that I&rsquo;m going to run into the Asset Pipeline at some point or another, so I might as well get to know it a little better. Here&rsquo;s a little refresher just in case you haven&rsquo;t seen the Asset Pipeline in awhile, either.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Why bother?</h2>

<p>Once upon a time, before Rails 3.0, anytime you wanted to include a JavaScript or CSS file in your application, you had to manually do it by including either a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> or a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag, like so:</p>

<p><code>&lt;script src="jquery.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code><br>
<code>&lt;link href="custom.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/&gt;</code></p>

<p>Imagine doing that for every single file in your application. Are you in pain yet? Yeah, me too.</p>

<p>Now imagine being able to create as many JavaScript and CSS files as your heart desired, <em>and</em> being able to include all of them together in one single, long concatenated file that would be delivered whenver the browser makes a page request.</p>

<p>Guess what? That&rsquo;s exactly what the Asset Pipeline does. Ultimately, the goal of the Asset Pipeline is to make your life as a programmer that much easier by helping you organize your JavaScript and CSS files (which, let&rsquo;s face it, you are going to <em>have</em> to use):</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I think empty folder and empty files are two of the pivotal innovations in Rails that has encouraged us to write clean applications since the framework appeared. And I think this is true because when you have a place for everything and everything is in it&rsquo;s place, things feel nice.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>&ndash; David Heinemeier Hansson, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGdCI2HhfAU"><em>RailsConf 2011</em></a></p>

<h2>Explain me some pipeline</h2>

<p>The Asset Pipeline works directly with your JavaScript and CSS files (also known as assets), and functions within three main directories:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <code>app/assets</code> directory: for files that are owned by the application &amp; specific to the current project (such as custom images, JavaScript files or stylesheets).</li>
<li>The <code>lib/assets</code> directory: for assets for your own libraries&#8217; code.</li>
<li>The <code>vendor/assets</code> directory: for external libraries that are owned by someone else (for example, JavaScript plugins or CSS frameworks).</li>
</ol>


<p>Within your <code>assets</code> directory are two subdirectories: <code>app/assets/javascripts/</code> and <code>app/assets/stylesheets/</code>. The Asset Pipeline compiles any JavaScript and CSS files that you add to these folders and automatically adds them to every page of your application.</p>

<p>Within these folders are <em>manifests</em>, which, in the case of your CSS files, would be included as part of the default application layout in the <code>app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss</code> directory. A manifest sets directives to provide the exact order and list of files that should be concatenated and included in the single CSS file that is delivered to the browser.</p>

<h2>So&hellip;what exactly is a directive, again?</h2>

<p>Directives are nothing more than directions of which files to grab and glob together. In the comments at the top of any manifest, you can find something that looks like <code>*= require_tree</code>, which is a directory that includes the current directory plus its subdirectories.</p>

<p>The most basic directive is <code>require</code>, which will concatenate the content of the specified file only once into the final packaged asset (called the &ldquo;bundle&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Another common directive is <code>include</code>, which is similar to <code>require</code>, except that if it reads the same file more than once, it will insert it into the bundle again.</p>

<p>Other directives like <code>require_self</code> and <code>require_directory</code> are useful in grabbing the current file (such as the manifest file), a specified directory.</p>

<p>Directives are always are processed in the order that they are read in the file, with <code>require_tree</code> being the one exception to this rule.</p>

<h2>Help me help you (or just use a helper method)</h2>

<p>The Asset Pipeline has helper methods to make your life a little easier. Two of the most common helper methods are the <code>stylesheet_link_tag</code> and <code>javascript_include_tag</code>, which can be used to add CSS &amp; JavaScript to any page of your application.</p>

<p>Another useful method is <code>link_to</code>, which can replace the anchor <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags while linking to other parts of your application. This method takes two parameters: the string displayed as the anchor text for the link, and the route:</p>

<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ul</span> <span class="n">class</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;nav&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">li</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= link_to &#39;Super Cute Kittens&#39;, kittens_path %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">  &lt;%=</span> <span class="n">render</span> <span class="s1">&#39;layouts/navigation_links&#39;</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This helper method is pretty awesome because it allows you name a route and then target all of your link locations to your <code>routes.rb</code> file. This is particuarly great you&rsquo;re moving your website from say, <code>www.cats.com</code> to a new and improved dynamic website that follows RESTful conventions, like maybe <code>www.supercutekittens.com</code>. Imagine having to create absolute URLs for every single link on that website! Ok, don&rsquo;t panic, you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>

<h2>Protip:</h2>

<p>When you generate a scaffold or a controller(<code>rails g scaffold</code> or <code>rails g controller</code>), Rails also generates a JavaScript/CoffeeScript file and a CSS/SCSS file for that controller! This means that when I make my CatsController, Rails will also add a new file at <code>app/assets/javascripts/cats.js.coffee</code> and another at <code>app/assets/stylesheets/cats.css.scss</code>.</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Keeping your assets in their proper place will make you a happier and more organized programmer.</li>
<li>The Asset Pipeline will make your application perform better. Remember that it&rsquo;s easier (and faster) for your browser to request one large file from the server, rather than a ton of small ones.</li>
<li>Other things to look into: <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#what-is-fingerprinting-and-why-should-i-care-questionmark">Fingerprinting</a>, which makes the name of a file dependent purely on its content. When the file contents change, the filename also changes.</li>
<li>The Asset Pipeline is magical, yet <em>super</em> difficult to learn. You probably won&rsquo;t understand everything all at once. But hopefully you feel a less confused than this little guy. He&rsquo;s clearly had too much pipeline for one day:</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Controllers: we all have &lsquo;em. Sure, they put the C in MVC, but how much do we really <em>know</em> about these mysterious creatures? Probably not a lot. Don&rsquo;t you wish you could just look your Controller in the eye and be all, &ldquo;Hey dude, what <em>are</em> you?&rdquo; Well, you can. All you have to do is just poke around a bit in your code.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with what we <em>do</em> know. Given the MVC orientation of Rails, we already know that the Controller acts as a kind of mediator, intercepting messages between the client and the server, and passing information between the model and view. But ultimately, Controllers are nothing more than Ruby classes (that inherit from ActionController::Base) with class methods called &ldquo; actions&rdquo;, which are simply meant to render a template for the user to see. But don&rsquo;t mistake them as simple chunks of code; there are also some pretty amazing things that Controllers can do.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>1. Controllers can have empty actions and STILL work.</h2>

<p>Okay, time to break the ice. Let&rsquo;s get to know our Controllers. Below is some generic code for a Controller for a guacamole app. First off is my main ApplicationController, which becomes a parent class for my GuacController to inherit from:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">ApplicationController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActionController</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">GuacController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">index</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">render</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>See that <code>render()</code> method? All it does is render the default template for the current controller and action. And since I&rsquo;m in the index action of the GuacController, this code would render the template <code>app/views/guac/index.html.erb</code></p>

<p>But what would happen if I had an empty <code>index</code> method?</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">GuacController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">index</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This would also render <code>app/views/guac/index.html.erb</code>. But&hellip;why? Well, the cool thing about Controllers is that they will call <code>render</code> by default, even if the action (in this case, <code>index</code>) doesn&rsquo;t call the <code>render</code> method explicitly. In fact, every single Controller action already has the render method implicitly within it!</p>

<p>And you know what&rsquo;s really crazy? This code would <em>also</em> render the same index page:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">GuacController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When Rails gets a request for the <code>index</code> action and sees that there&rsquo;s no such action in the GuacController, it assumes that if there <em>were</em> an <code>index</code> action, it would render <code>app/views/guac/index.html.erb</code>. So that&rsquo;s exactly what it does, even though you haven&rsquo;t even given it the code to do so explicitly.</p>

<p>Obie Fernandez explains why exactly this works in his book, <em>The Rails 4 Way</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The goal of the typical controller action is to render a view template—that is, to fill out the template and hand the results, usually an HTML document, back to the server for delivery to the client. Oddly—at least it might strike you as a bit odd, though not illogical—you don’t actually need to define a controller action, as long as you’ve got a template that matches the action name.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<h2>2. Controllers can render almost anything:</h2>

<p>Even though the <code>render</code> method is implicit and doesn&rsquo;t actually ever have to be written out by you, the programmer, it can actually be quite a handy little tool. You can use this method within a Controller action if you want it to render something <em>other</em> than its default template. For example, I could tell my GuacController to render any other file in my <code>app/views</code> directory by just using the <code>render</code> method.</p>

<p>This is useful for two different reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can render another action&rsquo;s template:
⋅⋅*For example, my <code>create</code> action in my GuacController could have something like <code>render action:'new'</code>, which would render my <code>app/views/guac/new.html.erb</code>. This could be super awesome if a new instance of <code>@guac</code> hadn&rsquo;t been saved.</p></li>
<li><p>You can render a different template entirely:
⋅⋅*If I was out of guac and I wanted my guac index page to actually render the template for my salsa index, I could explicitly render it by putting the following code in the <code>index</code> action of my GuacController: <code>render template:'/salsa/index.html.haml'</code>. Of course, this doesn&rsquo;t really answer the question of where all my guacamole went, but that&rsquo;s neither here nor there.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>3. Controllers are all for Convention over Configuration:</h2>

<p>Because of naming conventions for Controllers, if I have a Guac Controller, Rails assumes that there is a class called GuacController saved as a file <code>guac_controller.rb</code> in my <code>app/controllers</code> directory. It will also look for corresponding view templates for my GuacController in <code>app/views/guac</code>, and it will take the output of these views and save them as <code>guac.html.erb</code>.</p>

<p>Basically, your Controller makes a lot of assumptions whenever it gets a single web request. But, this also means that <em>you</em> can anticipate how your Controller might react by simply understanding what your Controller already knows and assumes about your code.</p>

<p>I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to say is&hellip;get to know each other.</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Your Controller does a lot of stuff for you without you even realizing it. To make the most of its magical powers, learn as much as you can about its conventions.</li>
<li>Play around with the <code>render</code> method to understand when it can be used and for what purposes.</li>
<li>Get to know your Controller. I&rsquo;m telling you: it will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Confession time: I&rsquo;m kind of in love with object-oriented programming.</p>

<p>I should probably clarify that I don&rsquo;t always understand OOP, and I sometimes even confuse myself for no good reason whenever the topic of &ldquo;self&rdquo; comes up. But hey, every relationship has its ups and downs, and I&rsquo;ve only really been committed to this one for the past week or so.</p>

<p>OOP is easy to understand mostly because of its strong connection to real life &ndash; everything is an object, all objects have properties/traits/characteristics, so on and so forth. But dealing with multiple <em>types</em> of objects across different types of <em>classes</em> gets real tricky, <em>real</em> fast. This especially holds true when it comes to class inheritance.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>WTF is inheritance?</h2>

<p>Inheritance in object-oriented programming is pretty much exactly what it sounds like: when one class <strong>inherits</strong> the properties of another class, just like how you inherit traits from your parents (even if you might wish otherwise).</p>

<p>Okay, maybe an example here will help:</p>

<p>Imagine that you have a class called <code>BakedStuff</code>, which includes all the baked goods your heart could ever desire. Every instance (every <em>object</em>) of this <code>BakedStuff</code> class has a <code>name</code>, baking <code>time</code>, and <code>baking_temperature</code>, which we&rsquo;ll set to default at 375 degrees.</p>

<p>And for good measure, let&rsquo;s also throw in a little method in there called <code>bake_for</code>, which is just going to return a string that will tell us how much time to bake our treats for, and at what temperature.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Nothing <em>too</em> complicated about it, right?</p>

<p>Now I can create an actual object and pass in the correct parameters. I can even ask the cake how long I should bake it for, which would look something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">cake</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">BakedStuff</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;cake&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;30 min&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">cake</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">bake_for</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>would output: <code>To make cake, bake for 30 min at 375 degrees Fahrenheit.</code></p>

<p>Awesome. I love cake. But you know what I like even more than cake? Cookies! Just like in my first class, I want to make a new <code>Cookie</code> class, which will also have a name, time, baking temperature, and <code>bake_for</code> method. Now, I could theoretically rewrite all of my code from the <code>BakedStuff</code> class, but then I&rsquo;d have less time to bake and I&rsquo;m also pretty sure that goes against the whole &ldquo;DRY&rdquo; concept in Ruby.</p>

<p>What I <em>could</em> do is have my new <code>Cookie</code> class <em>inherit</em> everything from my <code>BakedStuff</code> class, since I want all my new instances of <code>Cookie</code> to share the same methods as my <code>BakedStuff</code> class.</p>

<p>Let me try it:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Whoa! New code!</p>

<ul>
<li>That <code>&lt;</code> sign is what we use to denote inheritance. All it means is that my <code>Cookie</code> class is now <em>inheriting</em> all the methods from my <code>BakedStuff</code> class.</li>
<li>Notice that this class has some additional features, including a new instance method that sets the <code>cookies_made</code>.</li>
<li>But wait, what&rsquo;s that <code>super</code> thing doing in there??</li>
</ul>


<h2>WHUT is <code>super</code>?</h2>

<p>The <code>super</code> keyword in Ruby is, well, pretty super. Okay, okay, what it <em>really</em> does is allow you to call methods up the &ldquo;inheritance hierarchy&rdquo;, which means that you can use methods that were previously defined in classes that this class now inherits from.</p>

<p>In fact, <code>super</code> is what allows me to pull down everything from my <code>initialize</code> and <code>bake_for</code> methods in my parent class, which in this case is my <code>BakedStuff</code> class. You&rsquo;ll also notice that I&rsquo;ve reassigned my <code>@time</code> variable to equal 20 minutes, and that I&rsquo;ve added a string interpolation into my <code>bake_for</code> method. And I didn&rsquo;t have to retype any of the code from my parent class in the process!</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at what an object of the Cookie class could look like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">cookies</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Cookie</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;cookies&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">15</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">400</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">cookies</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">bake_for</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>would output: <code>To make cookies, bake for 20 min at 400 degrees fahrenheit. This recipe will yield 15 cookies.</code></p>

<p>Okay, one last example. Let&rsquo;s say that my favorite kind of cookie is a Snickerdoodle. I want it to inherit from its parent class, <code>Cookie</code>, but I also want to jazz the <code>Snickerdoodle</code> class up a little bit. I&rsquo;m going to change its <code>bake_for</code> method and make a little counter that will tell me exactly how many snickerdoodles I&rsquo;ve got left.</p>

<p>This would look something like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Now let me actually create a batch of snickerdoodles:</p>

<p>Now for the tricky part. What do you think will happen if I create a new batch of cookies in my <code>Cookie</code> class? Do you think I&rsquo;ll get a cookie counter? Do you think my <code>Cookie</code> class will be affected by my <code>Snickerdoodle</code> class? Let&rsquo;s try it and see:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">chocolate_chip_cookie</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Cookie</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;chocolate chip cookies&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">24</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">chocolate_chip_cookie</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">bake_for</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>which outputs: <code>To make chocolate chip cookies, bake for 20 min at 375 degrees Fahrenheit. This recipe will yield 24 cookies.</code></p>

<p>And what about if I create a new pie?</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">pie</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">BakedStuff</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;pie&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;45 min&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">450</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">pie</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">bake_for</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>outputs: <code>To make pie, bake for 45 min at 450 degrees Fahrenheit.</code></p>

<p>Interesting. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter at all that I changed my <code>Cookie</code> class &ndash; <code>BakedStuff</code> stayed the same. And all the edits I made to my <code>Snickerdoodle</code> class didn&rsquo;t fall up to my <code>Cookie</code> class, either. That&rsquo;s because inheritance only works in one direction, from the parent class, down to its children.</p>

<p>I should also mention that <code>super</code> didn&rsquo;t change my parent classes either; all it did was bring the already-created methods from my parent classes down to its children. It&rsquo;s actually passing all the arguments to the parent class&#8217; method.</p>

<p>Finally, it&rsquo;s crucial to remember that a class can only inherit from one class at a time. Something like <code>Snickerdoodle &lt; Cookie &lt; BakedStuff</code> would have raised an error. Also, remember that instance variables have nothing to do with class inheritance, since they are not defined by the class itself!</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Class inheritance is an incredibly powerful tool. Use it.</li>
<li>The <code>super</code> keyword can save you a ton of time. Remember that it only works with methods of a class, and <em>not</em> instance variables. Read more about it <a href="http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/ruby_inheritance.html">here</a> and <a href="http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/ruby_overriding_methods.html">here</a></li>
<li>Cookies just make everything better (just in case it wasn&rsquo;t obvious already).</li>
</ul>
