<div class="entry-content"><p>Two weeks ago, I was introduced to the Asset Pipeline. I didn&rsquo;t really think much of it at first, and part of me even assumed that I&rsquo;d never really have to see it again. It was a little like going out on a pretty forgettable first date &ndash; nothing particularly intriguing about the whole thing, but it somehow leaves you feeling kind of confused and generally rather perplexed.</p>

<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing: I <em>did</em> see the Asset Pipeline again. And boy was it awkward. After learning JavaScript this week and brushing up on my Rails, I realized that I&rsquo;m going to run into the Asset Pipeline at some point or another, so I might as well get to know it a little better. Here&rsquo;s a little refresher just in case you haven&rsquo;t seen the Asset Pipeline in awhile, either.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Why bother?</h2>

<p>Once upon a time, before Rails 3.0, anytime you wanted to include a JavaScript or CSS file in your application, you had to manually do it by including either a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> or a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag, like so:</p>

<p><code>&lt;script src="jquery.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code><br>
<code>&lt;link href="custom.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/&gt;</code></p>

<p>Imagine doing that for every single file in your application. Are you in pain yet? Yeah, me too.</p>

<p>Now imagine being able to create as many JavaScript and CSS files as your heart desired, <em>and</em> being able to include all of them together in one single, long concatenated file that would be delivered whenver the browser makes a page request.</p>

<p>Guess what? That&rsquo;s exactly what the Asset Pipeline does. Ultimately, the goal of the Asset Pipeline is to make your life as a programmer that much easier by helping you organize your JavaScript and CSS files (which, let&rsquo;s face it, you are going to <em>have</em> to use):</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I think empty folder and empty files are two of the pivotal innovations in Rails that has encouraged us to write clean applications since the framework appeared. And I think this is true because when you have a place for everything and everything is in it&rsquo;s place, things feel nice.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>&ndash; David Heinemeier Hansson, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGdCI2HhfAU"><em>RailsConf 2011</em></a></p>

<h2>Explain me some pipeline</h2>

<p>The Asset Pipeline works directly with your JavaScript and CSS files (also known as assets), and functions within three main directories:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <code>app/assets</code> directory: for files that are owned by the application &amp; specific to the current project (such as custom images, JavaScript files or stylesheets).</li>
<li>The <code>lib/assets</code> directory: for assets for your own libraries&#8217; code.</li>
<li>The <code>vendor/assets</code> directory: for external libraries that are owned by someone else (for example, JavaScript plugins or CSS frameworks).</li>
</ol>


<p>Within your <code>assets</code> directory are two subdirectories: <code>app/assets/javascripts/</code> and <code>app/assets/stylesheets/</code>. The Asset Pipeline compiles any JavaScript and CSS files that you add to these folders and automatically adds them to every page of your application.</p>

<p>Within these folders are <em>manifests</em>, which, in the case of your CSS files, would be included as part of the default application layout in the <code>app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss</code> directory. A manifest sets directives to provide the exact order and list of files that should be concatenated and included in the single CSS file that is delivered to the browser.</p>

<h2>So&hellip;what exactly is a directive, again?</h2>

<p>Directives are nothing more than directions of which files to grab and glob together. In the comments at the top of any manifest, you can find something that looks like <code>*= require_tree</code>, which is a directory that includes the current directory plus its subdirectories.</p>

<p>The most basic directive is <code>require</code>, which will concatenate the content of the specified file only once into the final packaged asset (called the &ldquo;bundle&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Another common directive is <code>include</code>, which is similar to <code>require</code>, except that if it reads the same file more than once, it will insert it into the bundle again.</p>

<p>Other directives like <code>require_self</code> and <code>require_directory</code> are useful in grabbing the current file (such as the manifest file), a specified directory.</p>

<p>Directives are always are processed in the order that they are read in the file, with <code>require_tree</code> being the one exception to this rule.</p>

<h2>Help me help you (or just use a helper method)</h2>

<p>The Asset Pipeline has helper methods to make your life a little easier. Two of the most common helper methods are the <code>stylesheet_link_tag</code> and <code>javascript_include_tag</code>, which can be used to add CSS &amp; JavaScript to any page of your application.</p>

<p>Another useful method is <code>link_to</code>, which can replace the anchor <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags while linking to other parts of your application. This method takes two parameters: the string displayed as the anchor text for the link, and the route:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ul</span> <span class="n">class</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;nav&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">li</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= link_to &#39;Super Cute Kittens&#39;, kittens_path %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">  &lt;%=</span> <span class="n">render</span> <span class="s1">&#39;layouts/navigation_links&#39;</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This helper method is pretty awesome because it allows you name a route and then target all of your link locations to your <code>routes.rb</code> file. This is particuarly great you&rsquo;re moving your website from say, <code>www.cats.com</code> to a new and improved dynamic website that follows RESTful conventions, like maybe <code>www.supercutekittens.com</code>. Imagine having to create absolute URLs for every single link on that website! Ok, don&rsquo;t panic, you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>

<h2>Protip:</h2>

<p>When you generate a scaffold or a controller(<code>rails g scaffold</code> or <code>rails g controller</code>), Rails also generates a JavaScript/CoffeeScript file and a CSS/SCSS file for that controller! This means that when I make my CatsController, Rails will also add a new file at <code>app/assets/javascripts/cats.js.coffee</code> and another at <code>app/assets/stylesheets/cats.css.scss</code>.</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Keeping your assets in their proper place will make you a happier and more organized programmer.</li>
<li>The Asset Pipeline will make your application perform better. Remember that it&rsquo;s easier (and faster) for your browser to request one large file from the server, rather than a ton of small ones.</li>
<li>Other things to look into: <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#what-is-fingerprinting-and-why-should-i-care-questionmark">Fingerprinting</a>, which makes the name of a file dependent purely on its content. When the file contents change, the filename also changes.</li>
<li>The Asset Pipeline is magical, yet <em>super</em> difficult to learn. You probably won&rsquo;t understand everything all at once. But hopefully you feel a less confused than this little guy. He&rsquo;s clearly had too much pipeline for one day:</li>
</ul>
