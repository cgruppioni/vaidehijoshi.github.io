<p>Snowmageddon. Snowpocalypse. The Deep Freeze of 2015. You can call it whatever you want, but we can all agree on one thing: it&rsquo;s so damn cold outside. In fact, it&rsquo;s so cold that I recently saw this error message while debugging a Postgres issue:
<code>RuntimeError: can't modify frozen Hash</code></p>

<p>My first thought was, naturally, <em>holy shit, even my hashes are frozen</em>. I did a little digging, and it turns out that we aren&rsquo;t the only ones susceptible to these chilly temperatures. Apparently, objects can also freeze!</p>

<p>So, in honor of the frozen tundra that we all seem to currently inhabit, I decided to explore the icy-cold depths of Rails frozen objects. Before you read on though, you should know: I&rsquo;m going to use only gifs from the Disney animated film, <em>Frozen</em> â€” don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn you.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Objects As Cold As Ice</h2>

<p>First things first: what&rsquo;s a frozen object? Well, they&rsquo;re frozen, which means they can&rsquo;t change &ndash; they&rsquo;re immutable and cannot be modified. There are some objects in Ruby that are perpetually frozen, such as any <code>Fixnum</code>, <code>Bignum</code>, <code>Float</code>, and <code>Symbol</code> objects.</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/Fjy5XItIvYjEQ" width="480" height="269" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p><br></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve probably worked with all of these objects before, but may not know that they&rsquo;re actually frozen! Don&rsquo;t believe me? Well, you can check for yourself. Just call the <code>frozen?</code> method on any object of this class:</p>

<pre><code>$ irb
2.2.0 :001 &gt; 1.frozen?
 =&gt; true
2.2.0 :002 &gt; a = :im_a_symbol
 =&gt; :im_a_symbol
2.2.0 :003 &gt; a.frozen?
 =&gt; true
2.2.0 :004 &gt; 3.14.frozen?
 =&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>This kind of makes sense though, right? Imagine if I could just start rewriting values all over the damn place. I could set <code>1</code> equal to <code>nil</code> and make <code>2</code> equal <code>3</code>, and then we&rsquo;d really hit crazytown.</p>

<p>Frozen objects keep certain things secure and certain in Ruby (and also in Rails!) So, freezing objects is a&hellip;good thing? Well, yes. But also, no.</p>

<h2>The Freeze Method: A Cold Piece Of Work</h2>

<p>Just as there&rsquo;s a method to check whether an object is <code>frozen?</code> or not, there&rsquo;s also a method to freeze mutable objects and make them immutable called &ndash; you guessed it &ndash; <code>freeze</code>. This method is pretty simple: yuo just call it on an object in order to rpevent further modifications to said object. If you <em>do</em> try to modify the object after freezing it, you&rsquo;ll get a <code>RuntimeError</code>:
<code>
2.2.0 :005 &gt; x = {1 =&gt; 'a', 2 =&gt; 'b', 3 =&gt; 'c'}
 =&gt; {1=&gt;"a", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}
2.2.0 :006 &gt; x.freeze
 =&gt; {1=&gt;"a", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}
2.2.0 :007 &gt; x.frozen?
 =&gt; true
2.2.0 :008 &gt; x[1] = 'b'
RuntimeError: can't modify frozen Hash
</code></p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/oYKesMM459o4w" width="480" height="200" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>But before you get all Elsa on me and start freezing everything, you should know some things about how to use the <code>freeze</code> method as a responsible developer:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First and foremost: don&rsquo;t try to call a <code>defrost</code> or <code>thaw</code> method, because there&rsquo;s no such thing. In fact, there is <em>absolutely no way</em> to unfreeze an object. It simply cannot be undone. So, proceed with great caution when freezing things. Or maybe just don&rsquo;t do it at all.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>freeze</code> method operates on an object reference, not on a variable. Wait, whut? If this sounds like Ruby objects aren&rsquo;t actually being modified, but their references are instead, well&hellip;that&rsquo;s totally right.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I really liked the way that Michael Morin explained this in <a href="http://ruby.about.com/od/qa/ss/Can-T-Modify-Frozen-String.htm">his post</a> on frozen objects:</p>

<blockquote><p>When you freeze a hash, it just freezes the references to the objects it already has, it doesn&rsquo;t actually freeze the objects themselves. The frozen hash won&rsquo;t know the difference here. This is an important thing to understand about freezing objects, it&rsquo;s not recursive. All freezing does is prevent the references the object holds from being modified.</p></blockquote>

<p>While we can&rsquo;t unfreeze &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; objects, this particular quality gives us a little bit leeway to get around the lack of a thaw method.</p>

<h2>Chill Out, But Don&rsquo;t Freeze</h2>

<p>There are a few different ways to change an immutable frozen object (which, hello, aren&rsquo;t actually frozen, just their references are). One thing you can do is create a duplicated object, which will <em>not</em> be frozen and therefore, completely mutable:
<code>
2.2.0 :009 &gt; x.dup
 =&gt; {1=&gt;"a", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}
2.2.0 :010 &gt; y = _
 =&gt; {1=&gt;"a", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}
2.2.0 :011 &gt; y.frozen?
 =&gt; false
2.2.0 :012 &gt; x.frozen?
 =&gt; true
2.2.0 :013 &gt; y[1] = 'b'
 =&gt; "b"
2.2.0 :014 &gt; y
 =&gt; {1=&gt;"b", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}
</code></p>

<p>Keep in mind, however, that this only changes the data in the duplicated object, not the original one! So&hellip;what now? Well, since only the reference to an object is frozen, that means that you can modify the actual data inside of the frozen object:
<code>
2.2.0 :015 &gt; x[1] &lt;&lt; 'bc'
 =&gt; "ab"
2.2.0 :016 &gt; x
 =&gt; {1=&gt;"abc", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}
2.2.0 :017 &gt; x.frozen?
 =&gt; true
</code></p>

<p>Weird, right!? Our <code>x</code> variable, which points to the <code>Hash</code> object, is still very much frozen. But, we can modify the data and values inside of the object itself. Since we don&rsquo;t want to make an actual copy of the variable, we can instead modify the objects held within that variable (in our case, we&rsquo;re directly modifying the <code>String</code> object, which is a the value of a key in this frozen Hash)</p>

<h2>Freezing Out Those Error Messages</h2>

<p>Cool, so this I guess this is a thing in Ruby. But wait &ndash; it&rsquo;s also a pretty important thing in Rails! Objects in Rails are infinitely more complicated than in Ruby, mostly because you&rsquo;re dealing with ActiveRecord and its methods. Whenever you&rsquo;re trying to delete an ActiveRecord object, you depend on the <code>destroy</code> method.</p>

<p>For example, I use this method in my bookstore app, and I have a <code>delete</code> action in my <code>BooksController</code> that contains code that looks something like this:
<code>ruby
@book = Book.find(1)
@book.destroy
</code></p>

<p>Now if I wanted to modfiy this book&rsquo;s type after I delete it, I&rsquo;d get an error:
<code>
[1] pry(main)&gt; @book.type = 'hardcover'
TypeError: can't modify frozen hash
</code></p>

<p>Why is this? Well, even though I deleted the object, it still exists in the <code>@book</code> variable, which still retains all the attributes of the object. Once I destroy the record, the object became frozen. Since the object&rsquo;s attributes hash is frozen, when I try to modify it, I get this error.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Persistence.html#method-i-destroy">Rails documentation</a> explains how it implements the <code>freeze</code> method, stating that <code>destroy</code> method:</p>

<blockquote><p>Deletes the record in the database and freezes this instance to reflect that no changes should be made (since they can&rsquo;t be persisted).</p></blockquote>

<p>To avoid creating a <code>@book</code> object that&rsquo;s frozen and still hanging around for no apparent reason, I could instead implicitly delete the object in a single line. Either this:
<code>ruby
Book.find(1)destroy
</code>
or
<code>ruby
Book.destroy(1)
</code>
would work.</p>

<p>Alternatively, I could just use the <code>delete</code> method, which doesn&rsquo;t instantiate an object, but isntead directly removes the row from the database.</p>

<p>Frozen objects are in front of us everyday. Ruby actually uses the <code>freeze</code> method when you copy certain objects. According to <a href="http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/mutable_and_immutable_objects.html">this post</a>, when you use a string as a key of a <code>Hash</code> object, the string is copied, frozen, and then that duplicated copy is used as the key of the hash. This is pretty cool because this means that even if the original string is modified, the duplicated one isn&rsquo;t affected because it has been frozen! The same goes for filenames: internal operations of an application rely on a frozen copy of a filename, rather than the original one.</p>

<p>Once you understand the functionality of <code>freeze</code>, it becomes a lot easier to understand those weird error messages. Soon, you&rsquo;ll no longer fear the ice, but instead bask in the sun. Or&hellip;something more poetic.</p>

<p>Anyways, here&rsquo;s a dancing snowman:</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>You can use the <code>freeze</code> method to make mutable objects immutable. To check whether an object can be modified or not, use the <code>frozen?</code> method, which will return a boolean value.</li>
<li>Certain Ruby objects, such as integers, floats, and symbols, are always frozen and cannot be modified.</li>
<li>Someone made a <a href="https://github.com/zizkovrb/melt">melt gem</a> &ndash; for realsies!</li>
<li>Some people are <a href="http://m.onkey.org/ruby-i-don-t-like-3-object-freeze">not big fans</a> of the weird functionality of Ruby <code>freeze</code>. But it&rsquo;s still worth it to <a href="http://blog.adamstegman.com/activerecord-hangs-on-to-destroyed-relations.html">learn how it works</a>, especially since it can be <a href="http://blog.adamstegman.com/activerecord-hangs-on-to-destroyed-relations.html">super helpful</a> for <a href="http://www.devarticles.com/c/a/Ruby-on-Rails/Updating-and-Deleting-with-the-Active-Record/2/">debugging Rails apps</a>.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This blog post is part of a series on Class Inheritance. Read Part 1 <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2014/10/16/class-inheritance/">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>I recently stumbled upon this line of code that totally floored me. I mean, I had to drop everything I was doing and do some serious Googling, my friends. Well, that and also I asked my fellow developers at work who are far more seasoned programmers than me.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m going to share this line of code with you, but you&rsquo;ve got to try not to totally freak out if you haven&rsquo;t seen it before. Are you ready? Ok, here we go:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class SomeObject
  class &lt;&lt; self
    def some_method
      "A string returned by some_method."
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Are you with me? Did you make it past the second line? Do I need to call an ambulance? Well, if your reaction was anything like mine, you saw <code>class &lt;&lt; self</code> and experienced something akin to an aneurysm.</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/ds8khI25lsR3y" width="480" height="255" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s agree on one thing right here, right now: everything in Ruby is an object. No matter how crazy it&rsquo;s about to get, just remember that. In fact, it&rsquo;s worth repeating again: <em>Everything in Ruby is an object &ndash; <strong>even a class</strong>.</em></p>

<p>Got it? Okay, now let&rsquo;s figure what the hell that code means, exactly.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Class Methods, Because Your Instances Should Never Be Too Greedy</h2>

<p>In order to understand the meaning behind <code>class &lt;&lt; self</code>, we first need to understand the <code>&lt;&lt; self</code> syntax. Let&rsquo;s recap a couple basics about class inheritance first:</p>

<ol>
<li>Classes can have two different types of methods: class methods, which can be called on a <code>Class</code> object, and instance methods, which can only be called on <em>instances</em> of a <code>Class</code> object.</li>
<li>There are multiple ways to create class methods:</li>
</ol>


<p>You can use <code>self</code> as the receiver of a method within a class, which is probably the most common way of defining a class method:
<code>ruby
class Book
  def self.type
    "paperback"
  end
end
</code>
You can also define a method on the class name (for example, class <code>Book</code>), which implies that the entire <code>Class Book</code> object can receive the <code>type</code> method:
<code>ruby
def Book.type
  "paperback"
end
</code>
But, you can also do this:
<code>ruby
class &lt;&lt; Book
  def type
    "paperback"
  end
end
</code>
And &ndash; wait for it &ndash; this:
<code>ruby
class Book
  class &lt;&lt; self
    def type
      "paperback"
    end
  end
end
</code></p>

<p>Okay, so that funky <code>class &lt;&lt; self</code> syntax is just another way of defining a class method? But&hellip;but how?</p>

<h2>One Method To Rule Them All</h2>

<p>So, we know that class methods are a good place to put all the behavior and functionality of <em>all instances</em> of that class. If you want all instances of your <code>Book</code> objects to have a title and an author, you&rsquo;d want that behavior to be put into the <code>Book</code> class, since all instances of Book will inherit from their parent class.</p>

<p>But, what if you wanted a particular instance of a <code>Book</code> to have a specific kind of functionality. Well, you definitely wouldn&rsquo;t want to define a method on the class, because it&rsquo;s only a particular instance that you care about. So why not define a method on that particular instance, then?</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">great_gatsby = Book.new
charlottes_web = Book.new

def charlottes_web.wilbur
  "Some Pig"
end

charlottes_web.type
# =&gt; "paperback"

charlottes_web.wilbur
# =&gt; "Some Pig"

great_gatsby.type
# =&gt; "paperback"

great_gatsby.wilbur
# =&gt; NoMethodError: undefined method `wilbur' for #&lt;Book:0x007fc8ebb01bc8&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>At first glance, nothing here seems all that weird, right? Both the books have access to the <code>type</code> class method, which we defined earlier, while only the <code>charlottes_web</code> <code>Book</code> object has access to the <code>wilbur</code> method. Ruby seems to know that the <code>wilbur</code> method is scoped only to this instance, but it also knows that this instance has other methods &ndash; class methods &ndash; that are also accessible to it. But how is this actually possible?</p>

<p>Well, the answer is for two reasons: <strong>singleton methods</strong> and Ruby&rsquo;s <strong>method lookup chain</strong>.</p>

<p>Singleton methods are methods defined on an object itself, rather than on an object&rsquo;s class. Ruby&rsquo;s method <a href="http://madebydna.com/images/posts/object_method_lookup.gif">lookup chain</a> is pretty intricate:</p>

<p><img src="http://madebydna.com/images/posts/object_method_lookup.gif" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<p>An object inherits from its class, and its class can inherit from many more objects, which will then inherit from <code>Object</code>, which inherits from the great grandma of all objects in Ruby: <code>BasicObject</code>. Remember: <em>everything in Ruby is an object &ndash; even a class.</em></p>

<p>So at this point, you&rsquo;re probably wondering what this has to do with class methods. Well, a lot, actually.</p>

<h2>A Class Of One&rsquo;s Own</h2>

<p>We can create all the singleton methods we want, but where do they all go? Not in the <code>Book</code> class, that&rsquo;s for sure. So where do we put them, exactly?</p>

<p>It turns out, an object&rsquo;s singleton methods all go into their own neat little class called an <strong>eigenclass</strong>, which is just another name for a singleton class. The word &ldquo;eigen&rdquo; comes from a German term meaning &ldquo;one&rsquo;s very own&rdquo;. I personally like to call it an eigenclass because it minimizes confusion between singleton methods and classes. Also, throwing down terms like <em>eigenclass</em> make you sound like a total badass.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the cool thing about eigenclasses: they&rsquo;re totally hidden. I should warn you though, the thing that makes them cool is the very same thing that makes them complicated. Because they&rsquo;re hidden and anonymous, you obviously can&rsquo;t see them and so it&rsquo;s hard to figure out where in the method lookup path they are. Here&rsquo;s the trick, though: whenever you open up an eigenclass, you shift up the original class.</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/jXMtxrFs292so" width="480" height="202" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p><br></p>

<p>In my book example, the <code>charlottes_web</code> object inherits from the <code>Book</code> class. But when I created the <code>wilbur</code> method, I opened up the object&rsquo;s eigenclass, and shifted up the original <code>Book</code> class. Now, the <code>charlottes_web</code> object inherits from its eigenclass, which in turn inherits from the <code>Book</code> class. The <code>Book</code> class has now become the superclass of our object.</p>

<p>Okay, that was a lot. To recap, here&rsquo;s the most important stuff to know about the mysterious eigenclass:</p>

<ol>
<li>An eigenclass is an anonymous class that is created to hold an object&rsquo;s singleton methods.</li>
<li>The anonymous eigenclass then becomes the object&rsquo;s immediate class, which it inherits from.</li>
<li>The original class is re-designated as the superclass of the anonymous eigenclass.</li>
<li>But because eigenclasses are hidden, when you call <code>charlottes_web.class</code>, it will return <code>Book</code>.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Reveal Thyself, You Eigen, You!</h2>

<p>So, eigenclasses don&rsquo;t show themselves. Cool. Except not cool. Because I want to see it! Well, you can see it, but you have to do a little extra work to make the magic happen. Actually, all you have to do is add a method available to all Ruby <code>Object</code>s, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Object
  def eigenclass
    class &lt;&lt; self
    # This is what opens the eigenclass of the object that is the reciever of the eigenclass method

      self
      # Now we are in the scope of the eigenclass, and "self" is now the
      # eigenclass object. Since we are returning self, we will get to see what
      # the eigenclass actually looks like!

    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>We open up the eigenclass of the object when we use the <code>class &lt;&lt; self</code> syntax. And once we open it up, we are in the scope of the eigenclass. Here, <code>self</code> is now the eigenclass object (everything in Ruby is an object!), and since we are returning <code>self</code>, we will get to see what the eigenclass actually looks like:</p>

<pre><code>charlottes_web.eigenclass
 =&gt; #&lt;Class:#&lt;Book:0x007fc8ebaf3c08&gt;&gt;
charlottes_web.eigenclass.class
 =&gt; Class
charlottes_web.eigenclass.superclass
 =&gt; Book
charlottes_web.eigenclass.superclass.superclass
 =&gt; Object
charlottes_web.eigenclass.superclass.superclass.superclass
 =&gt; BasicObject
charlottes_web.eigenclass.superclass.superclass.superclass.superclass
 =&gt; nil

charlottes_web.singleton_methods
 =&gt; [:wilbur]
charlottes_web.eigenclass.singleton_methods
 =&gt; [:type]
</code></pre>

<p>Interesting. So, the eigenclass of our <code>charlottes_web</code> object does look pretty anonymous, and you might not even notice its weirdness at first. But, it does clearly seem to be a <code>Class</code> object and, as we expected, was inserted into the method lookup chain right between the object and the <code>Book</code> class.</p>

<p>But if you look at the last two lines and their value, that&rsquo;s where stuff gets really interesting. The <code>wilbur</code> method, which we defined on a particular instance of an object, is a singleton method on only that object. The <code>type</code> method, however, lives in the <em>eigenclass</em> of that object.</p>

<p>Is it all coming together now? While the <code>wilbur</code> method could only be called on an instance, the <code>type</code> method can be called on an entire class. So, perhaps you&rsquo;re not not technically creating a class method, but more of an &ldquo;eigenclass class method&rdquo;. In fact, there actually is no such thing as a &ldquo;class method&rdquo; &ndash; you&rsquo;re actually inside of the eigenclass when you create that. But effectively, it&rsquo;s the same thing, because you can&rsquo;t see an eigenclass and it still inherits all the methods from a basic <code>Class</code> object.</p>

<h2>WAT</h2>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/i9nkolRQgbN9C" width="480" height="362" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p><br></p>

<p>If all of this was Greek to you, don&rsquo;t worry. This is just honestly really hard stuff. At the end of the day, all you <em>really</em> need to know is that <code>class &lt;&lt; self</code> is just another way of defining a class method. That and, <em>everything</em> in Ruby is an object.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of debate about whether or not using the <code>class &lt;&lt; self</code> syntax is helpful or just confusing. Personally, I like to use it when I have a lot of class methods to define. It can keep your code clean and easy to read, and helps you avoid typing out <code>self.method</code> multiple times.</p>

<p>But, if DRYing out your code is more confusing to you than helpful, you should probably avoid it. It&rsquo;s more about personal preference than anything else. Find a style that works for you and try not to think too much about all the crazy anonymous classes spinning around your head. Try being the keyword here.</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Technically speaking, there&rsquo;s actually no such thing as a <em>class method</em> in Ruby. You&rsquo;re always opening up the eigenclass/singleton class of an object whenever you define a class method. Keep in mind that there are many different syntaxes you can use in order to achieve this!</li>

<p>No matter where you&rsquo;re from, what programming language you prefer, or which JavaScript framework you&rsquo;re committed to, I think you&rsquo;ll agree with me on one thing: time is a bitch. And no, I don&rsquo;t mean the wrinkles on your forehead kind of time (although that sucks too); I&rsquo;m talking about time as a programming concept.</p>

<p>I mean, you create some migrations, build some models, make some API calls, but then time shows up and brings down the party. I happened to learn all about programming&rsquo;s royal pain in the ass while working with the <a href="http://instagram.com/developer/">Instagram API</a> last week. After I finally got my code working, I took a look at my JSON response and saw this strange creature:
<code>
"created_time": "1423694433"
</code></p>

<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t know what that was either. So I went down the rabbit hole and learned about all the different things there are to know about dealing with time in your Rails applications. So save yourself some time (HAHA get it, get it?) and get the lowdown below.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>In The Beginning, It Was&hellip;1970?</h2>

<p>Okay, so you know that weird JSON response I got? The one that looked like this crazysauce: <code>"1423694433"</code>.</p>

<p>Well, believe it or not, that&rsquo;s not just a random number &ndash; it&rsquo;s a representation of time. When I first saw this in my API reponse, I knew that this definitely was neither a typical Ruby <code>Time</code> object, nor something I&rsquo;d ever seen in any of the databases of my Rails applications (which usually uses the <code>datetime</code> format).</p>

<p>So, I asked the interwebz for help. It turns out that this format is something called <strong>Unix time</strong> (also sometimes referred to as POSIX time or Epoch time). Unix time is short for the &ldquo;Unix Epoch&rdquo;, which is what we refer to when we use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time formats</a>. Basically what you need to know is this: when the first computer turned on at 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on Thursday, January 1st, 1970, time officially began. I mean, time just <em>started</em>. The computer turned on and BOOM! It just started counting.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever played around in irb, you&rsquo;ve probably used this method to figure out what time it is:
<code>
â™¥ irb
2.1.2 :001 &gt; Time.now
 =&gt; 2015-02-16 18:29:23 -0500
</code>
But that&rsquo;s just one format of dealing with time. Want to know what time it is in the Unix Epoch? Simply apply the ever-handy <code>to_i</code> method:
<code>
2.1.2 :002 &gt; Time.now.to_i
 =&gt; 1424129416
</code>
And what if you want to convert a Unix timestamp (like the one in my JSON response) back to a Ruby <code>Time</code> object? Just use the <code>Time.at</code> method:
<code>
2.1.2 :003 &gt; Time.at(1423694433)
 =&gt; 2015-02-11 17:40:33 -0500
</code></p>

<p>Okay, okay &ndash; but what about all the stuff that happened before 1970? How do we account for that? I&rsquo;ll tell you how: NEGATIVE. NUMBERS.
<code>
2.1.2 :003 &gt; Time.at('-1423694433'.to_i)
 =&gt; 1924-11-19 20:19:27 -0500
</code>
Pretty sweet, right? Don&rsquo;t worry; I&rsquo;m about to complicate it a bit further.</p>

<h2>Even More Types of Time</h2>

<p>Another very common format for handling Time is ISO8601. There have been a lot of arguments <a href="http://japhr.blogspot.com/2009/01/iso-8601-is-only-date-format.html">in favor of ISO8601</a>, its YYYY-MM-DD formatting being one of the foremost reasons for that debate. The ISO8601 format is also supported by various libraries, and can be sorted easily, which makes it the ideal candidate for your database.</p>

<p>An important thing to remember about using ISO8601 is that it&rsquo;s part of the Ruby Standard Library, which means you must require it. (If you missed my explanation on the difference between the Ruby Standard Library and the Core Library, head over to <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/02/10/money-makes-the-world-go-round-using-money-rails-and-bigdecimal/">last week&rsquo;s post</a> to catch up.)</p>

<p>But if we play with ISO8601 in irb, you&rsquo;ll notice something kind of strange:
<code>
2.1.2 :004 &gt; require 'time'
 =&gt; true
2.1.2 :005 &gt; Time.now.iso8601
 =&gt; "2015-02-16T19:09:38-05:00"
2.1.2 :006 &gt; Time.now.utc.iso8601
 =&gt; "2015-02-17T00:09:34Z"
</code>
See that <code>Z</code> at the end of the string? That&rsquo;s how the <code>UTC</code> time zone is represented in ISO8601, with the <code>Z</code> short for &ldquo;Zero&rdquo; time. It&rsquo;s also worth reminding ourselves that Unix timestamps are also set in the <code>UTC</code> time zone.</p>

<h2>Goddamn Time Zones</h2>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/CsV1pnR9hYLuM" width="480" height="269" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>Look man, I&rsquo;m not gonna lie to you: time zones will jack your shit up. Time zone bugs are <em>so</em> common, it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re just waiting there patiently, hoping that you&rsquo;ll make a mistake.</p>

<p>But you&rsquo;re a Rails developer &ndash; ain&rsquo;t no time zone gonna stop you! Instead, you&rsquo;re going to make your code defensive and subscribe to these best practices:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Set your time zone in the <code>config/application.rb</code> file in your Rails app. Look for <code>config.time_zone</code>, and configure your time zone equal to that value. Rails will refer to that as your base time zone going forward, and ActiveRecord will convert between `UTC and your set time zone whenever you query.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the <code>in_time_zone</code> method to convert <code>Time</code> to your system&rsquo;s current set time zone. For example, <code>Time.now.in_time_zone("EST").iso8601</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code>Time.current</code> whenever you make an ActiveRecord query (ActiveRecord will convert <code>Time.current</code> and convert it to <code>UTC</code>: <code>Comment.where(["comments.published_at &gt; ?", Time.current])</code></p></li>
<li><p>DO NOT use <code>Time.now</code>! This returns <em>your</em> system&rsquo;s time, and ignores whatever time zone you configured for your Rails app. Instead, use numerical attributes and methods (such as <code>1.day.from_now</code> or <code>Date.current</code>), which rely on the time zone you configured in your <code>application.rb</code> to determine the return value.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>There are a lot of loopholes when it comes to dealing with Time zones. You can read more about them on <a href="http://www.elabs.se/blog/36-working-with-time-zones-in-ruby-on-rails">this super helpful post</a>.</p>

<h2>Time: Annoying, But Also&hellip;Awesome?</h2>

<p>Ok, don&rsquo;t get me wrong &ndash; time makes our lives miserable as developers. But it also presents some pretty epic challenges, which also makes our jobs interesting! (Look, I&rsquo;m trying to point out the silver lining here.)</p>

<p>For example, <strong>leap seconds</strong>. Yes, really &ndash; it&rsquo;s a thing. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second">Leap seconds</a> occur 1-2 times a year, on either June 30 and/or December 31st. They&rsquo;re necessary in order to keep the Earth&rsquo;s time of day close enough to the Sun&rsquo;s mean time. But, how do you account for this in programs? Well, Google actually does something pretty cool: instead of adding one second, Google&rsquo;s servers implement &ldquo;leap smears&rdquo;, which extend the seconds surrounding a leap second by just a little bit &ndash; enough to account for an entire extra second! Side note: the next leap second is on June 30th of this year! I hope you&rsquo;re ready.</p>

<p>Another bizarre thing is <strong>Y2038</strong>. If this sounds reminiscent of Y2K, that&rsquo;s because it is. Essentially, <a href="http://www.y2038.com/">the 2038 problem</a> boils down to this: On January 19, 2038, Unix timestamps will stop working because of a 32-bit overflow. So, all of the millions of applications that use this time format will have to either reconfigure to 64-bit systems, or choose a new format to store dates and times. There&rsquo;s supposedly no universal solution to this, but hopefully someone will figure out a fix in the next 22 years.</p>

<p>Hopefully by that point, someone will have figured out how to get rid of time zones completely.</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Unix timestamps and ISO8601 are both good formats for storing date and time in your database. Do a little research to decide <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15554586/timestamps-iso8601-vs-unix-timestamp">which of these formats</a> is the best tool for whatever job you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish.</li>
<li>Dealing with time zones is hard, but the <a href="http://danilenko.org/2012/7/6/rails_timezones/">Exhaustive Guide to Rails Time Zones</a> will save you hours of banging your head against the wall &ndash; well, for time-related things, at least.</li>
<li>Want to be a <code>Time</code> object superstar? Read <a href="https://unix4lyfe.org/time/?v=1">this post</a>, which was featured on HackerNews, and peruse the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org//core-2.2.0/Time.html">Ruby documentation</a> to get the skinny on all things time-related.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/webdr02/2013/3/26/12/enhanced-buzz-19756-1364314697-15.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<p>Mo money, mo problems. This is especially the case when you&rsquo;re a new developer trying to onboard onto a huge eCommerce Rails application.</p>

<p>No, but really - money is such a pain in the ass to deal with as a programmer. So much logic and detail goes into accepting a payment, processing a transaction, checking an order&rsquo;s status&hellip;and don&rsquo;t even get me <em>started</em> on shipping &ndash; seriously, I&rsquo;m saving the entire concept of shipping for another blog post.</p>

<p>But, at some point or another, you have to deal with other people&rsquo;s money. And you have to try and not screw it up, because apparently people really don&rsquo;t like that. So, how do you handle all those dolla dolla bills? Yup, you guessed it: with the <strong>money-rails library</strong> and Ruby&rsquo;s <strong>BigDecimal object</strong>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Get Dat Dough: Implementing Money-Rails</h2>

<p>Including the money-rails library is fairly simple: add <code>gem 'money-rails'</code> to your Gemfile and then <code>bundle</code> in your console.</p>

<p>But what exactly <em>is</em> this library, and how do you effectively use it? Well, that&rsquo;s another thing entirely.</p>

<p>The most important thing to note is that the <code>money-rails</code> library provides integration of the <code>money</code> gem for Rails applications. So, before you go around throwing about your dough every which way, here are a few things about the <code>money</code> gem to keep in mind:</p>

<ol>
<li>It gives you a <code>Money</code> class, and instances of this class (<code>Money</code> objects) contain all the information about a certain <em>amount</em> of money.  Provides a Money class which encapsulates all information about an certain amount of money, such as its value and its currency.</li>
<li>It provides you with a <code>Money::Currency</code> class, which contains all the information about a certain monetary unit. Instances of this class are how we will represent different currencies.</li>
<li>It includes APIs to exchange one kind of currency into another.</li>
<li>It represents money in <code>Integer</code> values, not <code>Float</code>, in order to avoid rounding errors.</li>
</ol>


<p>This last one is important, so try to remember it &ndash; we&rsquo;re going to come back to this in a bit.</p>

<h2>Make It Rain!</h2>

<p>Ok, time to get rich: let&rsquo;s make ourselves some money. Instantiating a <code>Money</code> object isn&rsquo;t too hard; simply create a new instance and pass it an amount and a currency:
<code>ruby
five_bucks = Money.new(500, "USD")  #=&gt; $5.00 USD
five_bucks.cents     #=&gt; 500
five_bucks.currency  #=&gt; Currency.new("USD")
</code></p>

<p>Notice that the amount must be passed in as cents, while the currency must be passed in as either a <code>String</code> or a <code>Money::Currency</code> object.</p>

<p>Money usually means math, so let&rsquo;s do some:
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">my_money</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Money</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">ldquo</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="no">USD</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">rdquo</span><span class="p">;)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">your_money</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Money</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1500</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">ldquo</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="no">USD</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">rdquo</span><span class="p">;)</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;p&gt;my_money + your_money == Money.new(4500, &amp;ldquo;USD&amp;rdquo;)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>You can also use the <code>parse</code> method, which takes in a symbol and number in a string format, and returns a <code>Money</code> object with the correct currency type:
<code>ruby
Money.parse("Â£60") == Money.new(60, "GBP")
</code></p>

<p>In addition to comparing currencies, you can create an access them as objects:
<code>ruby
currency = Money.new(60, "GBP").currency #=&gt; "Â£60.00 GBP"
currency.iso_code #=&gt; "GBP"
currency.name     #=&gt; "British Pound"
</code></p>

<p>You can access any information of a currency (which is, again, just a <code>Money</code> object), including its <code>name</code>, <code>iso_code</code>, <code>symbol</code>, and <code>delimiter</code>. And if you want to create a new currency, you&rsquo;d simply need to pass in the values as a hash into the <code>register</code> class method. There&rsquo;s also the <code>default_currency</code> class method, which does exactly what you think it does, and an <code>exchange_to</code> method, which can be super handy if you ever want to sell your products&hellip;well, basically anywhere.</p>

<p>So. You can make money now. Like, actually <em>create</em> it. Do you feel like a god yet? Okay good. Hold onto that feeling, because it&rsquo;s about to get a little more complicated.</p>

<h2>BigDecimal: Not Just Any Ol&#8217; Number</h2>

<p>When I was first playing around with this gem, I was much like you: young, naive, thoroughly amused by the fact that I could play with money in my console with (mostly) no consequences. And then I saw this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">#&lt;BigDecimal:7fbd6eab87f8,'0.8E1',9(36)&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><em>Um. What? Is that an association? An object? Is it even Ruby?</em></p>

<p>The answer to my questions were no, yes, and absolutely. Actually, that little guy up there is my new friend, <code>BigDecimal</code>. And by the time you finish reading this post, I think you&rsquo;re going to like him, too.</p>

<p>Okay, time for a quick exercise! Open up irb and type in: <code>1.01 - 1.00</code></p>

<pre><code>2.1.2 :001 &gt; 1.01 - 1.00
 =&gt; 0.010000000000000009 
2.1.2 :002 &gt; n = _
 =&gt; 0.010000000000000009 
2.1.2 :003 &gt; n &gt; 0.01
 =&gt; true 
</code></pre>

<p>Wait&hellip;Ruby thinks that the difference between <code>1.01</code> and <code>1.00</code> is greater than <code>0.01</code>? OH SHIT. DID WE BREAK RUBY?!</p>

<p>Nope, nope we did not. But, we <em>did</em> just discover the one true flaw of Ruby <code>Float</code>, which is that they can&rsquo;t store decimals very precisely. Apparently, the reason for this</a> is that floats are stored in a binary number format, which means that there&rsquo;s a lot of conversion from binary to decimal going on under the hood.</p>

<p>This probably doesn&rsquo;t seem all that important, but here&rsquo;s the thing: people really don&rsquo;t like it when you take their money. And when you use floats, you may very well be rounding up in cases when you really shouldn&rsquo;t be, which would result in some sort of numerical error.</p>

<p>Enter our new buddy, <code>BigDecimal</code>. We can do the exact same calculation with this object, but without the arbitrary rounding! If we try it out in irb, we&rsquo;ll get the number that we were originally expecting:</p>

<pre><code>2.1.2 :005 &gt; BigDecimal.new("1.01") - BigDecimal.new("1.00")
 =&gt; #&lt;BigDecimal:7fee2add1560,'0.1E-1',9(27)&gt; 
2.1.2 :006 &gt; n = _
 =&gt; #&lt;BigDecimal:7fee2add1560,'0.1E-1',9(27)&gt; 
2.1.2 :007 &gt; n.to_f
 =&gt; 0.01 
</code></pre>

<p>If you remember scientific notation from middle school, then you&rsquo;ll notice what&rsquo;s going on in <code>0.1E-1</code>, and how that converts to <code>0.01</code> when we called the <code>to_f</code> method on it. This takes more time, but it is far more accurate &ndash; something that&rsquo;s pretty important when it comes to the monies.</p>

<p>Remember earlier in the post when I told you to remember that the <code>money</code> gem uses <code>Integer</code> but not <code>Float</code>? Well, it also uses <code>BigDecimal</code> objects, for the same exact reason that we just discovered on our own.</p>

<h2>What Is Standard Cannot Be Core</h2>

<p>If your first reaction to reading this post was opening up irb and trying to make your own <code>BigDecimal</code> object, then you most certainly encountered this error:</p>

<pre><code>â™¥ irb
2.1.2 :001 &gt; BigDecimal.new
NameError: uninitialized constant BigDecimal
  from (irb):1
</code></pre>

<p>Before you freak out, let me assure you that I did not lie to you &ndash; <code>BigDecimal</code> most surely is a real thing. But it&rsquo;s not a core thing. What I mean by that is, <code>BigDecimal</code> is not part of the Ruby Core Library; it&rsquo;s actually part of the Ruby Standard Library.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking to yourself, <em>Whut?! Ruby has two different libraries?</em>, you&rsquo;d be right. But even though both deal with Ruby objects, there&rsquo;s a fundamental difference between the two.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/">Ruby Core Library</a> is what you use every day, including basic objects such as <code>String</code>, <code>Integer</code>, <code>Float</code>, <code>Array</code>, <code>Hash</code>, and many others. On the other hand, the objects in the <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.2.0/">Ruby Standard Library</a> may seem a little less familiar. Unlike the Core Library, objects from the Standard Library have to be explicitly required. <code>BigDecimal</code> objects are part of the Standard Library, as are <code>Abbrev</code>, <code>Logger</code>, and <code>Matrix</code> objects.</p>

<p>The Standard Library is an extension of the Ruby language. You will always have access to the Core Library, but if you want to use an object that exists outside of the Core Library, you&rsquo;ll need to specifically require it. So, if you want to play with <code>BigDecimal</code> in the console or use it in your application, you&rsquo;ll have to type this in to have access to the object: <code>require 'bigdecimal'</code>.</p>

<h2>More Bang For Your Buck</h2>

<p>When I first started reading about <code>BigDecimal</code>, I wondered why I had never run into this type of object before. How could I have missed it entirely? As a beginner, it may not sense to use this type of Ruby object at all, and it may very well slow you down. In fact, I think floats are the default object in use for a reason: they&rsquo;re much cheaper to use in memory, and can convert, lookup, and do arithmetic much faster than <code>BigDecimal</code>. Calculations on <code>BigDecimal</code> objects are much slower because they are objects, which take up <em>far</em> more space and memory. However, if you&rsquo;re actually dealing with currency values &ndash; building an ecommerce application, for example &ndash; <code>BigDecimal</code> still seems to be a clear winner to me.</p>

<p>The <code>money</code> gem and <code>money-rails</code> library provide a lot of flexibility when it comes to handling money in your application mostly because they create <code>Money</code> objects. I&rsquo;m a huge fan of object-oriented programming, and these libraries allow you to manipulate and access your currency with far more ease than if they were stored as simple integers, or even floats.</p>

<p>However, these resources are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to dealing with money in your Rails application. Another awesome library is <a href="https://github.com/RubyMoney/monetize">monetize</a>, which allows you to convert different types of Ruby objects into <code>Money</code> objects. Once you get the basic structure and namespacing of these libraries, learning about new ones will be a piece of cake. Pretty soon, you&rsquo;ll be breaking the bank with all your knowledge about using money in Rails. Maybe you&rsquo;ll even end up like this guy:</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <code>money-rails</code> library allows you to create <code>Money</code> objects, including different currencies. Ruby <code>BigDecimal</code> objects round more accurately and are more precise than <code>Float</code> objects, making them more preferable when working with money.</li>
