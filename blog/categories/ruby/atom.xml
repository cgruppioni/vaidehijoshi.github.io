<p>When you&rsquo;re a relatively new developer, it&rsquo;s easy to get caught up in all of the things that you don&rsquo;t know. And boy is <em>that</em> a long, long list of things. But there&rsquo;s also another list that we should probably consider and revisit from time to time: the list of all the things we thought we knew, but didn&rsquo;t <em>really</em> understand when we learned them.</p>

<p>Last week, while developing some curriculum for an Intro to Programming course, my co-teacher and I had one of those moments. We were trying to draw a diagram to explain the concept of an object &ldquo;receiving&rdquo; a method. As I looked back through our code snippets, I noticed that we were using very basic methods like <code>puts</code> and <code>gets</code> quite often, as most Ruby tutorials usually do. And then I realized something: I had no clue what the receiver of the <code>puts</code> method was.</p>

<p>We both just sat there, partly perplexed and partly dumbfounded. How could we not know how <code>puts</code> and <code>gets</code> really worked? We used them all the time when we were learning to code, so perhaps we didn&rsquo;t really think past the flexibility of these methods. But now that we are both more seasoned programmers, it seemed strange that we had never really thought about this before.</p>

<p>So, I did exactly what any good developer would do: I asked Twitter. Well, okay, I asked Twitter&hellip;and then I put on my detective hat and did some investigating of my own.</p>

<h2>Puts, I love you, but you&rsquo;re bringing me down</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">RUBYISTS, please help: what is the receiver of the puts and gets methods? Is it the main Object? I need to know, it&#39;s driving me crazy</p>&mdash; Vaidehi Joshi (@vaidehijoshi) <a href="https://twitter.com/vaidehijoshi/status/596465002669875201">May 8, 2015</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>I have a bone to pick with the <code>puts</code> method. Well, okay, two bones I guess. First, it has no explicit receiver:</p>

<pre><code>â™¥ irb
2.2.0 :001 &gt; puts "wat"
wat
 =&gt; nil 
</code></pre>

<p>And second, it&rsquo;s just REALLY hard to figure out what on earth is happening with this method. In fact, the hardest part about understanding <code>puts</code> was figuring out exactly <em>where</em> inside of Ruby it lived.</p>

<p>Apparently though, there&rsquo;s a method for that &ndash; well, two methods, actually. The <code>owner</code> and the <code>receiver</code> methods can be used to ask a method where it lives and who it can be called on. We can just pass it the name of the method we&rsquo;re curious about as a symbol, and then ask it where it belongs:</p>

<pre><code>2.2.0 :002 &gt; method(:puts).receiver
 =&gt; main 

2.2.0 :003 &gt; method(:puts).owner
 =&gt; Kernel 
</code></pre>

<p>WAT. It seemed like <code>main</code> was the receiver of this method, while <code>Kernel</code> was the owner, or the place where this method was actually defined.</p>

<p>But did that mean that <code>main</code> was also self within the context of <code>irb</code>? And what <em>was</em> <code>main</code>, exactly? There was only one way to find out:</p>

<pre><code>2.2.0 :004 &gt; method(:gets).receiver == self
 =&gt; true 

2.2.0 :005 &gt; self
 =&gt; main 

2.2.0 :006 &gt; self.class
 =&gt; Object
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty weird, right? But hang on&hellip;there was a line up there that was pretty new for me. Something about a <code>Kernel</code>? Let&rsquo;s do a bit more detective work.</p>

<h2>Tell Me &lsquo;Bout Them Kernels</h2>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/rambtrormFyWQ" width="480" height="268" frameBorder="0" style="max-width: 100%" class="giphy-embed" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>Okay, you&rsquo;re probably wondering: <em>So that <code>Kernel</code> thing &ndash; what&rsquo;s the deal?</em> Well, it turns out that <code>Kernel</code> is a module, and if you&rsquo;re like me, you probably haven&rsquo;t thought about it that much until now.</p>

<p>But what you might remember about modules is that they have to be mixed into a class in order to be included; that is to say, in order for a class or instances of a class to have access to methods in a module, that module has to be included or extended into the class.</p>

<p>Which means that <code>Kernel</code> has to be included into a Ruby class. But&hellip;which one? To figure out, we need to think back to what <code>self</code> was within the context of <code>irb</code>: <code>main</code>. If we try to ask <code>main</code> for its ancestors (so that we can deduce where the <code>Kernel</code> module is coming into play), we get this error:</p>

<pre><code>2.2.0 :007 &gt; main.ancestors
NoMethodError: undefined method `ancestors' for main:Object
  from (irb):75
  from /usr/bin/irb:12:in `&lt;main&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, not so great. But hang on a second&hellip;since we know that <code>main</code> is an instance of the <code>Object</code> class, we can just ask the <code>Object</code> class who its ancestors are!</p>

<pre><code>2.2.0 :008 &gt; Object.ancestors
 =&gt; [Object, Kernel, BasicObject] 
</code></pre>

<p>Nice! We found <code>Kernel</code>, and it looks like it&rsquo;s included the <code>Object</code> class. We can figure this out because it appears to the right of <code>Object</code>, which means it has been mixed into the class to its left.</p>

<p>So, if a method like <code>puts</code> is written in the <code>Kernel</code> module, what can it be called on? Who is doing the &ldquo;receiving&rdquo; of this method call? Well, according to <a href="http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/ref_m_kernel.html">the Ruby docs</a>, pretty much anything:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Kernel module is included by class Object, so its methods are available in every Ruby object. These methods are called without a receiver and thus can be called in functional form.</p></blockquote>

<p>So, theoretically-speaking, if the Kernel module is included by class Object, and is therefore available to <em>every</em> Ruby object, we should be able to call <code>puts</code> on a <code>String</code> instance, right?</p>

<pre><code>2.2.0 :009 &gt; "".puts('wat')
NoMethodError: private method `puts' called for "":String
  from (irb):79
  from /usr/bin/irb:12:in `&lt;main&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>Uh oh! Maybe we can&rsquo;t. But&hellip;why not?</p>

<h2>Global Functions</h2>

<p>If you are smart cookie, you probably read that error and guessed that <code>puts</code> is a private method defined on <code>Kernel</code>. We can confirm this by using the <code>private_method_defined?</code> method to double check:</p>

<pre><code>2.2.0 :010 &gt; Kernel.private_method_defined?(:puts)
 =&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>The fact that <code>puts</code> is a private method is important. It means that it can&rsquo;t be called explicitly by anyone else. But how is it, then, that we use this method so frequently and easily? Well, because its mixed in to class <code>Object</code>, it&rsquo;s accessible to any Ruby object &ndash; but only in the current context. This explains why <code>puts</code> never has to be called explicitly upon any object; instead, it will be called <em>implicitly</em> on whatever <code>self</code> happens to be. In other words, the method will be called on the current context of <code>self</code>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also pretty crucial that a method like <code>puts</code> can be called in the current context of self. In fact, that&rsquo;s exactly what allows us to do this within a Ruby class:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Class Duck
  def self.swim
    puts "We're swimming."
  end

  def quack
    puts "Quack quack!"
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>or something like this in <code>irb</code>:</p>

<pre><code>2.2.0 :011 &gt; puts "Waddle waddle"
Waddle waddle
 =&gt; nil 
</code></pre>

<p>Even though the context of <code>self</code> changes from the Duck Class, to an instance of a Duck, back to <code>main</code> in <code>irb</code>, we have access to <code>puts</code> in all contexts. It&rsquo;s kind of magical, if you think about it: a single private method, defined in a module, trickles down to all Ruby objects that descend from it!</p>

<p>And this magic has a name: <strong>global functions</strong> work. Since methods like <code>puts</code> are defined on the <code>Kernel</code> and mixed into the <code>Object</code> class, they are accessible <em>everywhere</em>. They&rsquo;re private methods, which means they must be invoked without an explicit receiver (also known as a &ldquo;function form&rdquo; of method invocation).</p>

<p>I really liked the way that <a href="https://codequizzes.wordpress.com/2014/04/22/rubys-kernel-module/">this blog post</a> explains the concept:</p>

<blockquote><p>Virtually all Ruby objects inherit from Object and have access to the methods defined in the Kernel module, so Kernelâ€™s private instance methods are accessible virtually anywhere in a Ruby program, regardless of self.</p></blockquote>

<p>And you know what&rsquo;s even cooler? These global functions defined on <code>Kernel</code> are used everywhere! In fact, you probably don&rsquo;t even realize that you use them. Here are some of the ones that surprised me:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>gets</code></li>
<li><code>chomp</code></li>
<li><code>sleep</code></li>
<li><code>require</code></li>
<li><code>gem</code></li>
<li><code>rand</code></li>
<li><code>gsub</code></li>
<li><code>proc</code></li>
<li><code>eval</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Yup. All of these methods are defined on <code>Kernel</code>, available to all objects (including <code>main</code> as <code>self</code> in <code>irb</code>), and don&rsquo;t need a receiver to be called!</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/gLRDi5KnA3Fte" width="480" height="374" frameBorder="0" style="max-width: 100%" class="giphy-embed" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>Now that you know where all these methods live and where they come from, you probably feel pretty powerful. You also will hopefully feel more purposeful when you write even a simple <code>puts</code> statement in a line of code.</p>

<p>Perhaps the moral of the story here is to never take code for granted: always question how it works and try to understand exactly what&rsquo;s going on in every line that you type.</p>

<p>The second moral is to use other developers on Twitter as resources to help you figure out what to Google, obvs.</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <code>Kernel</code> module is mixed into the <code>Object</code> class, which means all methods (including private methods!) defined on this module are accesible to all Ruby objects, making them &ldquo;global&rdquo; functions.</li>
<li>Even though a method&rsquo;s implicit receiver is <code>self</code>, the context of <code>self</code> changes depending on which class you are in; this is particularly important when dealing with &ldquo;global&rdquo; functions.</li>
<li>Curious about <code>main</code> and <code>self</code> in <code>irb</code>? Check out these two great <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/rubys-top-self-object/">blog</a> <a href="https://banisterfiend.wordpress.com/2010/11/23/what-is-the-ruby-top-level/">posts</a>.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/hofstadter.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<p>A really amazing thing happened to me last week: I wrote some code that I was actually proud of! I was trying to solve an interesting problem for an application I started building at work recently, and I implemented the first solution that came into my mind. And after I took a step back from my text editor and actually looked at what I had written, I realized something. My code was actually <em>good</em>.</p>

<p>The very fact that I was so surprised and thrilled at the prospect of writing good code speaks volumes to the nature of programming. Most of the time I abhor the methods I write because I know they could be written better, but I don&rsquo;t have the syntactical flow (yet!) to write them well. So last week&rsquo;s incident of &ldquo;code pride&rdquo;, however fleeting, was rather noteworthy.</p>

<p>I looked back on my code over the weekend and thought about what made it seem so beautiful to me. What did I do differently that made me beam with pride knowing that I had been the one to write that particular method? The short answer to that question is: metaprogramming. <strong>Metaprogramming</strong> is nothing more than abstraction of code, which often means that your code will write more code for you! Of course, there are a lot of different techniques and approaches to this, and I&rsquo;m certainly no expert. But I did learn a little something about a meta method called <code>public_send</code>, and I&rsquo;ll show you just how I used it!</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Gotta Dispatch? Do It Dynamically.</h2>

<p>Everything in Ruby &ndash; everything in programming, really &ndash; is just an abstraction. We sprinkle some syntactic sugar to make our lives easier and code simpler, but it&rsquo;s all just an abstraction of something else. When we&rsquo;re refactoring by metaprogramming, it&rsquo;s this same concept of abstraction that we have to keep in mind. And when we look for and find patterns within our code, it&rsquo;s generally a sign that we could be encapsulating and abstracting away that piece of functionality.</p>

<p>My favorite example of abstraction is <strong>method dispatching</strong>. Method dispatching is how we send a message to an object. And boy, do we do that a lot. Since everything in Ruby is an object, whenever you want an object to do something, you have to send it a message. And luckily, because Ruby is so great, the method we use to &ldquo;send&rdquo; messages is called just that: <code>send</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>send</code> method is called in our programs way more than we might realize. For example, if we open up our console and do some simple math:
<code>
2.2.0 &gt; 3 + 4
 =&gt; 7
</code>
what we&rsquo;re <em>really</em> doing is sending a message to the <code>3</code> Integer object, and telling it to perform an action (<code>+</code>) in terms of another object (the <code>4</code> Integer object):
<code>
2.2.0 &gt; 3.send(:+, 4)
 =&gt; 7
</code></p>

<p>The <code>send</code> method takes a parameter of either a string or symbol, which is the method name. The method name will always be the first parameter, and the second  parameters is passed to the method as an argument.</p>

<p>Now, this is great when you know that you want to add 3 and 4. But who is going to add 3 and 4 all of the time? No one, that&rsquo;s who. You&rsquo;re probably going to want to add 3 to 5, and 6, and on and on&hellip;</p>

<p>Enter <strong>dynamic dispatching</strong> to save the day!</p>

<p>Dynamic dispatching, as the slightly odd yet adorable gif above demonstrates, involves sending various messages (read: methods) to objects, with the added caveat that our methods keep changing, depending on the situation. Dynamic dispatching also allows us to send different methods to objects in our program without any other object knowing the contents of that message. A good indicator for using dynamic dispatching is if you have call a method in a specific situation, but don&rsquo;t know what exactly that method will be.</p>

<p>Confused yet? Okay, okay, let me give you an example.</p>

<h2>You Can Send Whuteva You Like</h2>

<p>Knowing that you can use <code>send</code> to &ldquo;send&rdquo; different methods to an object is only half the fun. The other half is figuring out when to pull out this tool from your Toolbelt of Knowledgeâ„¢ &ndash; yes, I&rsquo;m trademarking this phrase &ndash; and actually use it.</p>

<p>So&hellip;I guess it&rsquo;s time for me to show you a real-life example of how I used recently dynamic dispatch to invoke specific methods in my application! Hopefully to neither your surprise nor chagrin, I&rsquo;ll be using my eCommerce Bookstore example.</p>

<p>In my store, I have a paginated list of different books available for purchase. Each book has only a limited amount of space it can take up in the view, so as an admin of the site, it&rsquo;ll be up to me to decide how I want different books to show up. Some of my books have awesome book covers, so I want to use thumbnail images of their cover as the main &ldquo;viewable attribute&rdquo; in my store. Since I&rsquo;m using the <code>paperclip</code> gem, this will be pretty easy.</p>

<p>However, some books in my store don&rsquo;t even have book covers! My vast collection of Shakespearean plays, for example, would be much better served by making the author as the &ldquo;visible attribute&rdquo;, rather than nonexistent covers. And I think the <em>Game of Thrones</em> book series should have the book title as the &ldquo;visible attribute&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So, how can we handle this? Well, let&rsquo;s first look for any patterns.</p>

<h3>1. Look For Patterns</h3>

<p>In our view, we want to be able to show each <code>Book</code> object using its primary viewable attribute. The problem we&rsquo;re dealing with here is that an admin will mark different attributes for a <code>Book</code> object as &ldquo;viewable&rdquo;, which means that we can&rsquo;t predict whether it&rsquo;ll be a <code>title</code>, <code>author</code>, or an image. But we do know that every <code>Book</code> object has to have <em>some</em> &ldquo;viewable attribute&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Cool, so there is <em>some</em> sort of pattern emerging here: we need to render an attribute, and we don&rsquo;t know what it will be. Or&hellip;do we?</p>

<h3>2. Consider The Data</h3>

<p>Since we&rsquo;re building out an admin panel for this application, we know that every book needs to have a <code>title</code> and an <code>author</code>. The book cover (which we&rsquo;ll refer to as <code>media</code>) is optional, but the other two are not, which means we&rsquo;ll have a validation for our <code>Book</code> objects:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Book &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of :title, :author
end
</code></pre>

<p>This validation makes me think about the other things that will <em>always</em> be present on a <code>Book</code> object, and the first thing that comes to mind is a <code>viewable_by</code> attribute. If we think about it, an admin always has to mark <em>something</em> as &ldquo;viewable&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;viewable&rdquo; property can change when they update an object. So this is really a property unique to each <code>Book</code>, which means that it could very well be a column saved in the database.</p>

<p>So, we&rsquo;ll write a migration that adds a <code>viewable_by</code> column, which can never be <code>null</code>, and will always default to a <code>Book</code>&rsquo;s <code>title</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class AddViewableByToBooks &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :books, :viewable_by, :string, null: false, default: "title"
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This migration might look pretty simple, but it is its very simplicity that lends itself so elegantly to some serious metaprogramming that we&rsquo;ll do next.</p>

<h3>3. Encapsulate And Abstract</h3>

<p>This last part can be the hardest to wrap our minds around, but it also happens to be the coolest. As it stands, our database has a column that will be populated with either a string value <code>"title"</code>, <code>"author"</code>, or <code>"media"</code>. These values will be changed and updated by an admin, and they will obviously and inevitably change. But here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s not going to change: we&rsquo;re still going to want to render the value of whatever attribute is marked as &ldquo;visible&rdquo; &ndash; that is to say, whatever string value is saved as <code>viewable_by</code>.</p>

<p>If we think back to the pattern we just identified, we realize that the attribute changes, but what we want to do with it stays the same. No matter what the <code>Book</code> is <code>viewable_by</code>, we want to render it. We want to send a message to this object and tell it, <em>Hey Book! Whatever you are viewable by is exactly what you should show yourself as!</em></p>

<p>And this is where we can use <code>send</code> to encapsulate and abstract this away into a single method call. First, we&rsquo;ll want to add a method that checks whether this is an image &ndash; if it is, we&rsquo;ll hand it off to the <code>paperclip</code> gem to render the image:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">def show_cover?
  self.viewable_by == 'media'
end
</code></pre>

<p>This method will return <code>true</code> if we the <code>viewable_by</code> attribute is set to <code>media</code>, and <code>false</code> if it&rsquo;s not. We can use this <code>boolean</code> return value in a conditional statement:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">def book_html
  if show_cover?
    # Code here will generate and return
    # an html image tag to render in view.
  else
    send(self.viewable_by)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Whoaaaaa, whut is happening? The answer is: something cool! This <code>book_html</code> method will render either a thumbnail image (which we let some other code worry about generating), or it returns a <code>title</code> or an <code>author</code>. And what&rsquo;s really cool is that, we could add other attributes to our table &ndash; like <code>year</code> or <code>genre</code> and render html based on that, as long as it was saved in our <code>viewable</code> column.</p>

<p>How does this work exactly? Well, whenever we create a new column in our database, we get two important methods for free: a reader and a writer. That means that we have both a <code>title=</code> and a <code>title</code> method.</p>

<p>If we look back to how the <code>send</code> method works, we&rsquo;ll remember that the <code>send</code> method takes a parameter of a string or a symbol, which is the name of the method to be called. When we call <code>send</code> and pass it the value of <code>self.viewable_by</code>, we&rsquo;ll actually be calling <code>send("title")</code> on an instance of <code>Book</code>. This will then call <code>title</code> on that instance of <code>Book</code>, returning that particular book&rsquo;s title as a string.</p>

<p>The cool thing about this code is that it&rsquo;s flexible, and has abstracted away a pattern into a dynamic method call, which is dispatched to the appropriate object at the appropriate time. But there&rsquo;s still one major issue with this code that I can see. Let&rsquo;s fix that.</p>

<h2>To Send Or To Public Send? That Is The Question.</h2>

<p>A lot of the most incriminating evidence against using the <code>send</code> method stems from the fact that <code>send</code> can even send <em>private</em> methods to an object. This can be dangerous for your application internally, and also leaves it vulnerable to external, malicious attacks.</p>

<p>A quick fix for this is to instead use <code>public_send</code>, which does exactly what you think it does: send only publicly-accessible methods to the object that is its receiver. Our final code now looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Book &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of :title, :author

  def show_cover?
    self.viewable_by == 'media'
  end

  def book_html
    if show_cover?
      # Code here will generate and return
      # an html image tag to render in view.
    else
      public_send(self.viewable_by)
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Nice! Not too shabby for our first attempt at metaprogramming all the things (or at least one thing).</p>

<p>As hard as it is to do, you can&rsquo;t be too hard on yourself when it comes to refactoring and metaprogramming. I honestly think it just comes with time, practice, and exposure. Eventually, you&rsquo;ll start to recognize the same patterns again and again, and you&rsquo;ll start to learn which tools are the right ones for the job.</p>

<p>Even though it takes a bit more effort, I think learning the different techniques of metaprogramming makes you better and both reading and writing code. By rewriting your old code and implementing some of those metaprogramming techniques, you take away some of the otherwise hard-coded lines in your application, and make it more flexible and dynamic.</p>

<p>If any or all of this sounds intimidating, that&rsquo;s because it is! But it&rsquo;s also not impossible, as I&rsquo;ve recently proven to myself (and hopefully to you). Luckily, Ruby gives us a lot of tools to meta program away our boilerplate code. It&rsquo;s just a question of knowing what those tools are so that you can use them when you see the perfect opportunity. And when you finally metaprogram something, you&rsquo;ll be so impressed with yourself that you&rsquo;ll let out a little squeal of glee like this little kitty and it&rsquo;ll be the cutest thing ever:</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>We can use dynamic dispatching to send a method to an object without being explicit about the method&rsquo;s contents within our application. The <code>send</code> and <code>public_send</code> method are two ways of doing this, and both take a string or symbol as a parameter, and use that to call a method of the same name upon the receiving object.</li>
<li>Learn the basics of metaprogramming over <a href="http://ruby-metaprogramming.rubylearning.com/html/ruby_metaprogramming_2.html">here</a>, and check out the docs on <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Object.html#method-i-send">send</a> and <a href="http://apidock.com/ruby/Object/public_send">public_send</a>.</li>
<li>Curious about the different types of dynamic method calls out there? This <a href="http://ruby.about.com/od/oo/ss/Dynamic-Method-Calls.htm">blog post</a> covers a few different kinds in depth.</li>

<p>Up until two weeks ago, I had one great fear: <em>testing</em>. And, to be clear, when I say &ldquo;fear&rdquo;, what I actually mean is sheer terror.</p>

<p>My test-writing anxiety stems from the fact that I&rsquo;ve never really had to do it before. I mean, I&rsquo;ve had to make tons of tests <em>pass</em>, which means that I read other people&rsquo;s tests all the time. Yet I&rsquo;ve somehow made it thus far in my coding career without ever having to write relatively complex tests of my own. But that all changed a few weeks ago, when I was forced to finally confront my fear of testing.</p>

<p>The thing about conquering fears, however, is that usually involves doing the very thing that you&rsquo;re afraid of. So, I spent the better portion of a week learning how and when to write tests, all while encountering a couple painful bugs along the way. It was not a fun week, but the good news is that I can write a fully-functioning test suite now! And now that I know more about testing, I actually find it kind of fun &ndash; so fun, in fact, that I&rsquo;m going to share it with you!</p>

<h2>Ain&rsquo;t No Spec Like Rspec</h2>

<p>Before we get into the how and when of testing, we first need to setup our Rails application with <code>rspec</code>, a behavior-driven development framework built specifically for testing in Ruby.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll first want to add <code>rspec-rails</code> to our the development and test group in our <code>Gemfile</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">group :development, :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails'
end
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we&rsquo;ll run a quick <code>bundle install</code>, and then generate a <code>/spec</code> folder by running <code>rails generate rspec:install</code>. We now have access to a <code>rails_helper.rb</code> and <code>spec_helper.rb</code> file inside of our <code>/spec</code> directory.</p>

<p>Finally, we&rsquo;ll want to add files for everything that we want to test. But let&rsquo;s start simple for now and just test our <code>ReadingList</code> model. The path to this spec file should be <code>/spec/models/reading_list_spec.rb</code>, so we&rsquo;ll need to add a <code>models</code> directory and a <code>reading_list_spec.rb</code> file.</p>

<p>Once we&rsquo;ve done that, we can check that everything is setup properly by running our <code>rspec</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>â™¥ rspec
No examples found.


Finished in 0.00023 seconds (files took 0.08619 seconds to load)
0 examples, 0 failures
</code></pre>

<p>You know what needs to happen next, right? It&rsquo;s time for us to write some tests.</p>

<p>Okay, I feel your pain. But I promise, we&rsquo;re going to get through this together.</p>

<h2>Knowing What To Test</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found that the best way to start writing tests is by picking one section to work on first. Otherwise, it can just be so overwhelming and might make you want to give up completely. Let&rsquo;s take a look at what our <code>ReadingList</code> model:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class ReadingList &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
  has_many :books

  attr_accessor :read

  def books_read
    books.where(read: true).count
  end

  def books_unread
    books.where(read: false).count
  end

  def percentage_read
    read = books_read.to_f
    unread = books_unread.to_f

    calculate_percentage(read, unread)
  end

  def calculate_percentage(read, unread)
    ((read / unread) * 100).round(2)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Whoa, this seems like a lot. But fear not! Programming is nothing more than breaking down big problems into smaller, bite-sized pieces. And that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;ll do when writing these tests.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the <code>percentage_read</code> method to start. This is the instance method that we&rsquo;ll actually want to call somewhere in our view. It uses the number of books marked <code>read</code> (which will always be a boolean <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> value), and calculates the <code>User</code>&rsquo;s reading progress on the list, returning a percentage.</p>

<p>But even though this is the method we want to test, a deeper look reveals that it actually relies and calls upon three other methods: <code>books_read</code>, <code>books_unread</code>, and <code>calculate_percentage</code>. This should be a big red flag, because it means that we need to test these three methods individually, first. The flow of our code is actually directing us in our test-writing process: we can decide which tests to write and in which order by looking at our method&rsquo;s dependencies.</p>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s hop to it:</p>

<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ll start by first requiring <code>rails_helper</code> in our <code>reading_list_spec.rb</code>, and stubbing out our tests with a block:
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">lsquo</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="n">rails_helper</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">rsquo</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/li&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;/u</span><span class="n">l</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nb">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="no">RSpec</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">describe</span> <span class="no">ReadingList</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:type</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:model</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">describe</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">ldquo</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="c1">#percentage_read&amp;rdquo; do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>We can use a <code>describe</code> block to break up our tests into different sections. They will come in handy as our tests start to grow, and will make our test suite easier to read &ndash; not just when we come back to look at them later, but also when another developer digs through our code. The <code>#</code> symbol before our method name denotes that <code>percentage_read</code> is an instance method, another important distinction to make as we go about adding more tests.</p>

<ul>
<li>Next, we&rsquo;ll describe what our method <em>should</em> do by using <code>it</code> blocks</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="ruby">  describe "#percentage_read" do
    it "finds the number of read books in a list" do
    end

    it "finds the number of unread books in a list" do
    end

    it "calculates a percentage when given two values" do
    end

    it "calculates the percentage of books read in a list" do
    end
  end
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Now we need to add some data &ndash; but not too much! We only want enough data to test the functionality of our method. Let&rsquo;s create a list with two books, one marked read and the other not marked read. We&rsquo;ll add this before our <code>describe</code> and <code>it</code> blocks:</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="ruby">  let(:list) { ReadingList.create!(title: "Vaidehi's List" }
  let(:book1) { list.books.build(title: "A Game Of Thrones", read: true) }
  let(:book2) { list.books.build(title: "A Storm Of Swords", read: false) }
</code></pre>

<p>Wait, what&rsquo;s that <code>let</code> doing in there? The answer is: something magical! It creates an instance of <code>ReadingList</code> and makes a reference to it called <code>list</code>, which is then accessible to us in each of our <code>it</code> blocks. The <code>let</code> syntax is <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/2bcz12/newbie_to_rspec_why_use_let_instead_of_a_local/">an alternative</a> to creating local variables inside <em>every single</em> one of our <code>it</code> blocks.</p>

<ul>
<li>Finally, we&rsquo;ll add some expectations for our model&rsquo;s behavior when each method is called. Our finished test suite now looks like this:</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="ruby">RSpec.describe ReadingList, :type =&gt; :model do
  let(:list) { ReadingList.create!(title: "Vaidehi's List" }
  let(:book1) { list.books.build(title: "A Game Of Thrones", read: true) }
  let(:book2) { list.books.build(title: "A Storm Of Swords", read: false) }

  describe "#percentage_read" do
    it "finds the number of read books in a list" do
      expect(list.books_read).to eq(1)
    end

    it "finds the number of unread books in a list" do
      expect(list.books_unread).to eq(1)
    end

    it "calculates a percentage when given two values" do
      expect(list.calculate_percentage(3.0, 4.0)).to eq(75.00)
    end

    it "calculates the percentage of books read in a list" do
      expect(list.percentage_read).to eq(50.00)
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Each one of our tests is just a single line, specifying our exact expectations! Pretty awesome, right? This makes for relatively DRY code, which is pretty easy to understand.</p>

<h2>Testing Your Assumptions</h2>

<p>Now that we know <em>how</em> to write tests, it&rsquo;s time to address the question of <em>when</em> and <em>what</em> to test. Here&rsquo;s a good rule of thumb that I adhere to: <strong>test your assumptions</strong>. Whenever we write code, we make a ton of assumptions. The problem with making assumptions, however, is that you forget or don&rsquo;t realize that you made them, and then they end up coming back to screw you.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/e/e6/when_you_assume.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<p>In fact, even the tests we just wrote are based on a lot of assumptions. And there are a lot of things that we haven&rsquo;t considered. For example:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does the <code>read</code> attribute on a <code>ReadingList</code> object only accept a <code>boolean</code> value? What if someone tries to pass a non-boolean value as <code>read</code>?</li>
<li>What is the default value of the <code>read</code> attribute?</li>
<li>What if <code>read</code> is nil &ndash; what will break?</li>
<li>What if the return value of <code>books_unread</code> is <code>0</code>?</li>
</ol>


<p>Just FYI, I discovered the answer to number 4, which looks like this:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en"><p>Uh oh&#8230;I did a bad thing: <a href="http://t.co/uFZEkyCPRl">pic.twitter.com/uFZEkyCPRl</a></p>&mdash; Vaidehi Joshi (@vaidehijoshi) <a href="https://twitter.com/vaidehijoshi/status/583994491570229249">April 3, 2015</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>This is all to say that we must write tests for behavior that <em>should</em> and <em>should not</em> occur. We&rsquo;d probably want to write validations to prevent <code>nil</code> values, and we&rsquo;d definitely want to raise an error whenever we try to divide by <code>0</code>. We aren&rsquo;t just testing for what we can see &ndash; we also need to test for things we can&rsquo;t see, and any edge cases that we can think of.</p>

<p>Learning the how, when, and what of testing is a process that comes with time and practice. The more tests you write, the better you&rsquo;ll get at testing. Of course, there are few tips and tricks of the testing trade that can very quickly and easily save you a lot of heartache.</p>

<p>Tune in again next Tuesday, when I&rsquo;ll delve into generating fixtures for test data using FactoryGirl &ndash; a trick that&rsquo;s going to make your testing life so much easier.</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>All <code>rspec</code> tests have an <code>it</code> block, which describes what behavior is expected. This block should never be too big, and contains an assertion of what expected value should be returned.</li>
<li>The <code>let</code> syntax allows for lazy evaluation and keeps you from having to create a new instance of an object inside of every single <code>it</code> block. Check out more on the <code>let</code> and <code>let!</code> helper methods over on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17407733/trouble-differentiating-rspecs-let-vs-let">this Stack Overflow answer</a> or on <a href="https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/v/2-5/docs/helper-methods/let-and-let">this blog post</a>.</li>
<li>Use <code>describe</code> blocks to divide up your tests into sections, based on functionality and code cohesion. You can also use <code>context</code> blocks to assert different scenarios that could occur during one method call. Read about the <a href="http://lmws.net/describe-vs-context-in-rspec">difference between describe and context</a>.</li>

<p>It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. It was&hellip;refactoring time! Well it was for me yesterday, at least.</p>

<p>Refactoring your own code has a great payoff at the end, but boy, does it take some work to get there. Something I&rsquo;ve noticed about my own code recently is that I&rsquo;m now able to know that something needs to be refactored pretty easily. I&rsquo;ve been having a lot of gut feelings about parts of my code that just <em>feel</em> wrong, inefficient, and repetitive. The problem is, even though I know where my code is weak, I don&rsquo;t usually know <em>how</em> to go about making my code better.</p>

<p>And this is where making effective use of resources (read: The Art Of Effective Googling) comes quite in handy. Yesterday, however, I used even better resource &ndash; a more experienced developer! We took a look at my code and came up with some ways I could refactor it. I learned about a pretty interesting module that could save me lines of code and keep my application <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>. And now I get to share it with you! This module is called <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/forwardable/rdoc/Forwardable.html">Forwardable</a>, and trust me when I say that it&rsquo;s going to make you want to delegate all the things.</p>

<h2>Infatuation With Delegation</h2>

<p>Before we even get to Ruby&rsquo;s Forwardable module, let&rsquo;s first make sure we understand delegation. So, <em>whut</em> exactly is delegation? It&rsquo;s probably exactly what you imagine it to be. In plain English, when you delegate something to someone else, you divide up responsibilities amongst yourselves. For example, if I had someone to delegate all these blog posts to, I wouldn&rsquo;t have to write all of them myself! But I digress; back to programming.</p>

<p>Delegation in programming is not too different. When an object has a lot of responsibilities and things to do, it&rsquo;s generally easier to give some of those responsibilities to another object &ndash; a &ldquo;helper&rdquo; object &ndash; to avoid repetition and keep things working efficiently. Let&rsquo;s put this in some technical context for a hot minute: we can use a technique called <strong>encapsulation</strong> to pack a bunch of functionality into a single object&rsquo;s class and instance methods.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Ok, maybe you&rsquo;re not a fan of technical jargon. Maybe you&rsquo;d much rather prefer a real-life example of delegation? Alright, here you are:

<p>Ugh. You&rsquo;ve probably already recoiled in horror. We have a <code>Book</code> object, which has a <code>language</code>, <code>year</code>, <code>author</code>, and <code>title</code>. And we have a <code>Product</code> object, which creates a new instance of a <code>Book</code> object, and then pretty much repeats all those methods again, using the instance it creates in the <code>initialize</code> method.</p>

<p>We already know this code is bad. But how to go about refactoring it? Use Forwardable, obvs, and do some forwarding! We&rsquo;ll delegate all the handling of information to the <code>Book</code> object. Our <code>Product</code> class doesn&rsquo;t need to worry about that!</p>

<p>Cool. So how do we do this? Like so:</p>

<ul>
<li>Let&rsquo;s first get rid of all of those methods in the <code>Product</code> class. We&rsquo;ll keep our <code>initialize</code> method, since that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ll create a new instance of <code>Book</code> in order to have something that we can call methods on. Now our class looks pretty empty:</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="ruby">class Product 
  def initialize
    @book = Book.new
  end
end
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ll add the Forwardable module, part of the Ruby standard library, by extending it in the first line of the class:</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="ruby">extend Forwardable
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Now we&rsquo;ll specify the methods that we to call on a <code>Book</code> object <em>through</em> our <code>Product</code> class by using the <code>def_delegators</code> method, available through Forwardable:</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="ruby">def_delegators :@book, :language, :year, :author
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>We also want to get the title as well, but we want to rename that method as <code>info</code>. We can use <code>def_delegator</code> in order to do that:</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="ruby">def_delegator :@book, :title, :info
</code></pre>

<p>Now we&rsquo;ve cut down these two classes a lot. Our refactored code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Book
  def language
    "English"
  end

  def year
    "1926"
  end

  def author
    "Ernest Hemingway"
  end

  def title
    "The Sun Also Rises"
  end
end

class Product
  extend Forwardable

  def_delegators :@book, :language, :year, :author
    def_delegator :@book, :title, :info

  def initialize
    @book = Book.new
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>What can this refactored code actually do? Well, it lets us call <code>info</code> on a <code>Product</code> and get back the title of the book! And it allows us to call <code>year</code> directly on an instance of <code>Product</code>:
<code>
p = Product.new
 =&gt; #&lt;Product:0x007feb2183ea78 @book=#&lt;Book:0x007feb2183e9d8&gt;&gt;
p.year
 =&gt; "1926"
p.info
 =&gt; "The Sun Also Rises"
</code></p>

<p>But wait &ndash; we didn&rsquo;t write a <code>year</code> method in the <code>Product</code> class! Well, okay, we <em>kind</em> of did. We used <code>def_delegators</code>, to tell the <code>Product</code> class that it should respond to three methods: <code>language</code>, <code>author</code>, and <code>year</code>. And, we&rsquo;re telling the <code>Product</code> class to respond to each of these methods by calling it on an instance of <code>@book</code>.</p>

<p>And how did we rewrite that <code>title</code> method, exactly? We used <code>def_delegator</code> (singular, not plural!) to tell the <code>Product</code> class to respond to a method called <code>info</code> by calling <code>title</code> on <code>@book</code>. The reason that this works is only because we already have a <code>title</code> method defined on all instances of the <code>Book</code> class.</p>

<h2>Delegate Like You Mean It</h2>

<p>Using the Forwardable module comes in handy not just for refactoring, but also for your initial structuring of an application. Anytime you have an object handling lots of functionality, think about whether you can encapsulate that functionality into another class, and delegate the methods that aren&rsquo;t directly required into that &ldquo;helper&rdquo; class.</p>

<p>There are some great blog posts with examples of how to use the Forwardable module effectively. Here&rsquo;s an implementation on a Reading List class (think Goodreads):
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">def_delegator :@books, :shift, :remove_book</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">def_delegator :@books, :push, :add_book</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">def initialize</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">    @books = []</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">end      </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;/</span><span class="n">code</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="sr">/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;p&gt;end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s some pretty bomb stuff happening in such few lines. The <code>ReadingList</code> class gets initialized with an empty array, which we save as an instance variable, <code>@books</code>. Then we&rsquo;ve also our <code>def_delegators</code>, which delegate <code>map</code>, <code>size</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, and <code>shuffle</code> to the <code>@books</code>. And we have two methods that we (kinda) wrote: <code>remove_book</code> and <code>add_book</code>.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of stuff for 9 lines of code! So what can this do, exactly? Well, let&rsquo;s see our reading list in action:
<code>
vaidehis_list = ReadingList.new
 =&gt; #&lt;ReadingList:0x007feb21a6d0b0 @books=[]&gt;
vaidehis_list.add_book('For Whom The Bell Tolls')
 =&gt; ["For Whom The Bell Tolls"]
vaidehis_list.add_book('The Old Man And The Sea')
 =&gt; ["For Whom The Bell Tolls", "The Old Man And The Sea"]
 vaidehis_list.add_book('To Have And To Have Not')
 =&gt; ["For Whom The Bell Tolls", "The Old Man And The Sea", "To Have And To Have Not"]
vaidehis_list.size
 =&gt; 3
vaidehis_list.shuffle
 =&gt; ["For Whom The Bell Tolls", "To Have And To Have Not", "The Old Man And The Sea"]
vaidehis_list.remove_book
 =&gt; "For Whom The Bell Tolls"
vaidehis_list.size
 =&gt;
</code></p>

<p><em>Dayummmmm</em>. Pretty sweet, right? We get to call all these methods directly on our <code>ReadingList</code> class! But what are they actually getting called on? Well, by using <code>def_delegators</code> and <code>def_delegator</code>, we&rsquo;re telling our <code>ReadingList</code> class to call methods like <code>shift</code> and <code>shuffle</code> on our <code>@books</code> instance. And here&rsquo;s where it gets pretty cool: our <code>@books</code> variable is&hellip;an ARRAY.</p>

<p>Just in case you&rsquo;re not as enthused about this fact as I am, let me explain what this means. It means that we can have access to every single method available on an array instance. Just in case you&rsquo;re wondering, all instance of <code>Array</code>s have 113 methods available to them (not including the 54 methods available to all instance of <code>Object</code>)! All we&rsquo;d have to do is add a method (literally, you can choose any method available on an array) like <code>flat_map</code> to our <code>def_delegators</code> line, and tada! It&rsquo;s ours to use on our <code>ReadingList</code> object.</p>

<p>You can see how this can get pretty powerful, pretty fast. In just a few lines of code, we&rsquo;re exercising the functionality of an entire plain old ruby object (PORO), simply by delegating methods through Forwardable.</p>

<p>Okay, that was a lot of refactoring magic. I told you, right? Lots of effort, but lots of payoff! Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I apparently have some books to read.</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Delegation is the idea that an object can delegate a task to an associated &ldquo;helper&rdquo; object.</li>
<li>The Forwardable module uses <code>def_delegators</code> to delegate methods to another Ruby object, and <code>def_delegator</code> to rename a method that&rsquo;s being delegated to another object.</li>
<li>For another example of this module, read this <a href="http://oneofthesedaysblog.com/ruby-day-4-forwardable">incredibly thorough</a> blog post on implementing Forwardable.</li>

<p>Snowmageddon. Snowpocalypse. The Deep Freeze of 2015. You can call it whatever you want, but we can all agree on one thing: it&rsquo;s so damn cold outside. In fact, it&rsquo;s so cold that I recently saw this error message while debugging a Postgres issue:
<code>RuntimeError: can't modify frozen Hash</code></p>

<p>My first thought was, naturally, <em>holy shit, even my hashes are frozen</em>. I did a little digging, and it turns out that we aren&rsquo;t the only ones susceptible to these chilly temperatures. Apparently, objects can also freeze!</p>

<p>So, in honor of the frozen tundra that we all seem to currently inhabit, I decided to explore the icy-cold depths of Rails frozen objects. Before you read on though, you should know: I&rsquo;m going to use only gifs from the Disney animated film, <em>Frozen</em> â€” don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn you.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Objects As Cold As Ice</h2>

<p>First things first: what&rsquo;s a frozen object? Well, they&rsquo;re frozen, which means they can&rsquo;t change &ndash; they&rsquo;re immutable and cannot be modified. There are some objects in Ruby that are perpetually frozen, such as any <code>Fixnum</code>, <code>Bignum</code>, <code>Float</code>, and <code>Symbol</code> objects.</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/Fjy5XItIvYjEQ" width="480" height="269" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p><br></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve probably worked with all of these objects before, but may not know that they&rsquo;re actually frozen! Don&rsquo;t believe me? Well, you can check for yourself. Just call the <code>frozen?</code> method on any object of this class:</p>

<pre><code>$ irb
2.2.0 :001 &gt; 1.frozen?
 =&gt; true
2.2.0 :002 &gt; a = :im_a_symbol
 =&gt; :im_a_symbol
2.2.0 :003 &gt; a.frozen?
 =&gt; true
2.2.0 :004 &gt; 3.14.frozen?
 =&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>This kind of makes sense though, right? Imagine if I could just start rewriting values all over the damn place. I could set <code>1</code> equal to <code>nil</code> and make <code>2</code> equal <code>3</code>, and then we&rsquo;d really hit crazytown.</p>

<p>Frozen objects keep certain things secure and certain in Ruby (and also in Rails!) So, freezing objects is a&hellip;good thing? Well, yes. But also, no.</p>

<h2>The Freeze Method: A Cold Piece Of Work</h2>

<p>Just as there&rsquo;s a method to check whether an object is <code>frozen?</code> or not, there&rsquo;s also a method to freeze mutable objects and make them immutable called &ndash; you guessed it &ndash; <code>freeze</code>. This method is pretty simple: yuo just call it on an object in order to rpevent further modifications to said object. If you <em>do</em> try to modify the object after freezing it, you&rsquo;ll get a <code>RuntimeError</code>:
<code>
2.2.0 :005 &gt; x = {1 =&gt; 'a', 2 =&gt; 'b', 3 =&gt; 'c'}
 =&gt; {1=&gt;"a", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}
2.2.0 :006 &gt; x.freeze
 =&gt; {1=&gt;"a", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}
2.2.0 :007 &gt; x.frozen?
 =&gt; true
2.2.0 :008 &gt; x[1] = 'b'
RuntimeError: can't modify frozen Hash
</code></p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/oYKesMM459o4w" width="480" height="200" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>But before you get all Elsa on me and start freezing everything, you should know some things about how to use the <code>freeze</code> method as a responsible developer:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First and foremost: don&rsquo;t try to call a <code>defrost</code> or <code>thaw</code> method, because there&rsquo;s no such thing. In fact, there is <em>absolutely no way</em> to unfreeze an object. It simply cannot be undone. So, proceed with great caution when freezing things. Or maybe just don&rsquo;t do it at all.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>freeze</code> method operates on an object reference, not on a variable. Wait, whut? If this sounds like Ruby objects aren&rsquo;t actually being modified, but their references are instead, well&hellip;that&rsquo;s totally right.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I really liked the way that Michael Morin explained this in <a href="http://ruby.about.com/od/qa/ss/Can-T-Modify-Frozen-String.htm">his post</a> on frozen objects:</p>

<blockquote><p>When you freeze a hash, it just freezes the references to the objects it already has, it doesn&rsquo;t actually freeze the objects themselves. The frozen hash won&rsquo;t know the difference here. This is an important thing to understand about freezing objects, it&rsquo;s not recursive. All freezing does is prevent the references the object holds from being modified.</p></blockquote>

<p>While we can&rsquo;t unfreeze &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; objects, this particular quality gives us a little bit leeway to get around the lack of a thaw method.</p>

<h2>Chill Out, But Don&rsquo;t Freeze</h2>

<p>There are a few different ways to change an immutable frozen object (which, hello, aren&rsquo;t actually frozen, just their references are). One thing you can do is create a duplicated object, which will <em>not</em> be frozen and therefore, completely mutable:
<code>
2.2.0 :009 &gt; x.dup
 =&gt; {1=&gt;"a", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}
2.2.0 :010 &gt; y = _
 =&gt; {1=&gt;"a", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}
2.2.0 :011 &gt; y.frozen?
 =&gt; false
2.2.0 :012 &gt; x.frozen?
 =&gt; true
2.2.0 :013 &gt; y[1] = 'b'
 =&gt; "b"
2.2.0 :014 &gt; y
 =&gt; {1=&gt;"b", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}
</code></p>

<p>Keep in mind, however, that this only changes the data in the duplicated object, not the original one! So&hellip;what now? Well, since only the reference to an object is frozen, that means that you can modify the actual data inside of the frozen object:
<code>
2.2.0 :015 &gt; x[1] &lt;&lt; 'bc'
 =&gt; "ab"
2.2.0 :016 &gt; x
 =&gt; {1=&gt;"abc", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}
2.2.0 :017 &gt; x.frozen?
 =&gt; true
</code></p>

<p>Weird, right!? Our <code>x</code> variable, which points to the <code>Hash</code> object, is still very much frozen. But, we can modify the data and values inside of the object itself. Since we don&rsquo;t want to make an actual copy of the variable, we can instead modify the objects held within that variable (in our case, we&rsquo;re directly modifying the <code>String</code> object, which is a the value of a key in this frozen Hash)</p>

<h2>Freezing Out Those Error Messages</h2>

<p>Cool, so this I guess this is a thing in Ruby. But wait &ndash; it&rsquo;s also a pretty important thing in Rails! Objects in Rails are infinitely more complicated than in Ruby, mostly because you&rsquo;re dealing with ActiveRecord and its methods. Whenever you&rsquo;re trying to delete an ActiveRecord object, you depend on the <code>destroy</code> method.</p>

<p>For example, I use this method in my bookstore app, and I have a <code>delete</code> action in my <code>BooksController</code> that contains code that looks something like this:
<code>ruby
@book = Book.find(1)
@book.destroy
</code></p>

<p>Now if I wanted to modfiy this book&rsquo;s type after I delete it, I&rsquo;d get an error:
<code>
[1] pry(main)&gt; @book.type = 'hardcover'
TypeError: can't modify frozen hash
</code></p>

<p>Why is this? Well, even though I deleted the object, it still exists in the <code>@book</code> variable, which still retains all the attributes of the object. Once I destroy the record, the object became frozen. Since the object&rsquo;s attributes hash is frozen, when I try to modify it, I get this error.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Persistence.html#method-i-destroy">Rails documentation</a> explains how it implements the <code>freeze</code> method, stating that <code>destroy</code> method:</p>

<blockquote><p>Deletes the record in the database and freezes this instance to reflect that no changes should be made (since they can&rsquo;t be persisted).</p></blockquote>

<p>To avoid creating a <code>@book</code> object that&rsquo;s frozen and still hanging around for no apparent reason, I could instead implicitly delete the object in a single line. Either this:
<code>ruby
Book.find(1)destroy
</code>
or
<code>ruby
Book.destroy(1)
</code>
would work.</p>

<p>Alternatively, I could just use the <code>delete</code> method, which doesn&rsquo;t instantiate an object, but isntead directly removes the row from the database.</p>

<p>Frozen objects are in front of us everyday. Ruby actually uses the <code>freeze</code> method when you copy certain objects. According to <a href="http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/mutable_and_immutable_objects.html">this post</a>, when you use a string as a key of a <code>Hash</code> object, the string is copied, frozen, and then that duplicated copy is used as the key of the hash. This is pretty cool because this means that even if the original string is modified, the duplicated one isn&rsquo;t affected because it has been frozen! The same goes for filenames: internal operations of an application rely on a frozen copy of a filename, rather than the original one.</p>

<p>Once you understand the functionality of <code>freeze</code>, it becomes a lot easier to understand those weird error messages. Soon, you&rsquo;ll no longer fear the ice, but instead bask in the sun. Or&hellip;something more poetic.</p>

<p>Anyways, here&rsquo;s a dancing snowman:</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>You can use the <code>freeze</code> method to make mutable objects immutable. To check whether an object can be modified or not, use the <code>frozen?</code> method, which will return a boolean value.</li>
<li>Certain Ruby objects, such as integers, floats, and symbols, are always frozen and cannot be modified.</li>
<li>Someone made a <a href="https://github.com/zizkovrb/melt">melt gem</a> &ndash; for realsies!</li>
<li>Some people are <a href="http://m.onkey.org/ruby-i-don-t-like-3-object-freeze">not big fans</a> of the weird functionality of Ruby <code>freeze</code>. But it&rsquo;s still worth it to <a href="http://blog.adamstegman.com/activerecord-hangs-on-to-destroyed-relations.html">learn how it works</a>, especially since it can be <a href="http://blog.adamstegman.com/activerecord-hangs-on-to-destroyed-relations.html">super helpful</a> for <a href="http://www.devarticles.com/c/a/Ruby-on-Rails/Updating-and-Deleting-with-the-Active-Record/2/">debugging Rails apps</a>.</li>
