<p>There comes a time in the life of every developer when you stop thinking about whether your code works. Instead, you concern yourself with something else entirely: how <em>efficiently</em> your code works.</p>

<p>In fact, you can trace this back to Kent Beck&rsquo;s <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast">philosophy</a> of &ldquo;Make it work, make it right, make it fast.&rdquo; Once you&rsquo;ve got your code doing what you want it to do, you need to make it better. But what do you do with your improved code once you&rsquo;ve set it right? Make sure that it&rsquo;s working as fast as it possibly can, of course!</p>

<p>Code efficiency is a bit of an advanced topic, and I&rsquo;m definitely no expert in it. But I recently learned a pretty awesome querying method that&rsquo;s neither difficult to understand nor too complex to implement. In fact, this method has always been right under your nose, hidden inside of the magic that is ActiveRecord. So what is this magical method, exactly? Well, it&rsquo;s called <strong>includes</strong>, and once you start using it, you&rsquo;ll never make database queries the same way again.</p>

<h2>Inquiries on Querying</h2>

<p>The best way to know how to make your code run at warp drive is by first figuring out how fast it is to start with. But before we get into the issue of speed, let&rsquo;s check out what our code base looks like:

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>Nothing <em>too</em> fancy happening here. We&rsquo;ve got a one-to-many relationship here, with a <code>User</code> object having many <code>Orders</code>, and each <code>Order</code> belonging to a <code>User</code>. There&rsquo;s also a class method called <code>all_order_details</code> in our <code>User</code> class. This method queries for all of the <code>User</code> objects in our database, and loops through each <code>User</code> instance, grabbing each order, and calling <code>details</code> on it. And if we take a look at our <code>Order</code> class, we&rsquo;ll see that <code>details</code> is just an attribute on <code>Order</code>. (Forget what that weird <code>class &lt;&lt; self</code> syntax means? Jog your memory with <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/02/24/class-inheritance-part-2-singletons-and-eigens-oh-my/">this post</a> from a few weeks ago.)</p>

<p>Our plan is to use this method in an admin panel or dashboard, which is probably the only place where someone would want to see all the order details of every single order placed by every single user in our system. But even though we&rsquo;re not going to be using this method within all of our views, it&rsquo;s still important that we take a look at what it&rsquo;s doing in order to understand whether we can refactor it and make it faster.</p>

<p>So, this code does pretty much exactly what we want it to do. But how fast does it do its job? The only way to find out is by checking out what happens in our server logs when we call our method:
<code>
2.2.0 :001 &gt; User.all_order_details
  User Load (1.1ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users"
  Order Load (0.6ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 1]]
  Order Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 2]]
  Order Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 3]]
  Order Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 4]]
  Order Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 5]]
  Order Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 6]]
  Order Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 7]]
  Order Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 8]]
  Order Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 9]]
  Order Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 10]]
 =&gt; # returns an array of order details
</code></p>

<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa &ndash; hold up. We&rsquo;ve got a problem.</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/iJxHzcuNcCJXi" width="480" height="360" frameBorder="0" style="max-width: 100%" class="giphy-embed" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>Sure, we got an array of <code>Order</code> details, which is great. But doesn&rsquo;t it seem kind of weird that we had to make so many queries? Are the red flags going off in your head, too? Time to investigate.</p>

<h2>The N + 1 Problem</h2>

<p>Okay, so maybe you didn&rsquo;t recoil in horror when you saw all those queries. But let me explain why you probably should. In our database, we currently have 10 <code>Users</code>, each of whom has one <code>Order</code>. If we look at the queries we&rsquo;re currently making, you&rsquo;ll notice that we&rsquo;re first loading all of our <code>User</code> objects:
<code>ruby
User Load (1.1ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users"
</code></p>

<p>Loading all of our <code>Users</code> takes 1.1 milliseconds. But what about our <code>Order</code> details? We need to go through our <code>Users</code> table in order to grab each <code>Order</code>&rsquo;s details. That&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s happening in each one of the queries that looks like this:

Actually, our problem is quite common, and it&#39;s even got a name: **the n + 1 problem**.</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">The crux of the n + 1 problem is essentially this: the number of queries you make will directly correspond to the number of objects (n) that you have in your database.

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">Thankfully, this problem is so common that Rails has a fantastic solution, tailor-made to handle it.</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">## Smarter Querying</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">Rails is a pretty smart cookie -- it allows you to load a bunch of stuff at once ahead of time if you know exactly what you want to query. This is referred to as **eager loading**, and a really easy way to eager load your associations is by using the ActiveRecord method `includes`.</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">You can call `includes` on an object an pass it a parameter of the table you want to load as a symbol name. We can implement this directly on our `all_order_details` method:</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;/</span><span class="n">code</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="sr">/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;p&gt;def all_order_details</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">  User.all.includes(:orders).each |user|</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">    user.orders.each do |order|</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">      order.details</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">    end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">  end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>This may look pretty similar to our original code at first, but when we look at our server logs, we can see a world of difference:
<code>ruby
2.2.0 :002 &gt; User.all_order_details
  User Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users"
  Order Load (0.3ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."user_id" IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
 =&gt; # returns an array of order details
</code></p>

<p>Nice. We have something really cool happening here. Instead of making &ldquo;n + 1&rdquo; number of queries, we&rsquo;re only making two queries. We spend 0.2 milliseconds getting our users, and 0.3 milliseconds loading our orders. We&rsquo;re only spending 0.5 milliseconds compared to the 2.6 milliseconds we were spending before.</p>

<p>How does this work, exactly? Eager loading allows you to specify exactly which tables you want to load into memory. Just by loading them, we&rsquo;re reducing the number of queries we&rsquo;re making. It&rsquo;s like telling ActiveRecord, <em>Hey, I already know I want all the Users and I know I want to do something with their associated Orders. So instead of querying the table one instance at a time, why don&rsquo;t you just be super efficient and grab &lsquo;em all for me in one shot?</em> And that&rsquo;s pretty much exactly what Rails will do.</p>

<p>I also like the way that <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/active-record-queries">the Odin Project</a> explains how <code>includes</code> works:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Includes basically takes the name of one or more associations that you&rsquo;d like to load at the same time as your original object and brings them into memory. You can chain it onto other methods like where or order clauses.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Other helpful methods that do similar things to solve the n + 1 problem are <code>joins</code>, used for joining multiple tables together, and <code>pluck</code>, which grabs a specific column and returns it in an array format.</p>

<h2>Big O Puts the O In &ldquo;Uh Oh&rdquo;</h2>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/fcpJebgkQ14UE" width="480" height="192" frameBorder="0" style="max-width: 100%" class="giphy-embed" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>Dealing with issues of efficiency and speed is a pretty advanced topic, mostly because it gets into the deep depths of computer science and the dreaded concept of <strong>Big O Notation</strong>. Big O deals with the space time complexity of different algorithms.</p>

<p>The n + 1 problem is actually nothing more than a Big O problem, because it has to do with how well your algorithm runs. The Big O complexity of an n + 1 problem is <strong>O(n)</strong>, pronounced &ldquo;Oh of n&rdquo;. An O(n) algorithm is one whose performance will grow linearly, and will be directly proportional to the size of input data (the more <code>Users</code> we have, the larger our query of each user&rsquo;s order details).</p>

<p>Big O should always be <a href="http://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/">taken into consideration</a> while building an app. But that being said, it should never be the first thing that you think about &ndash; particularly if you are a reatively junior developer. The space time complexity of your algorithm is something you can think about while refactoring your code, or rethinking how you&rsquo;re approaching or solving a problem.</p>

<p>Being able to evaluate an algorithm&rsquo;s efficiency is definitely something to work towards, but it&rsquo;s also something that takes practice. Implementing ActiveRecord&rsquo;s <code>includes</code> method is a good way to start playing around with speed and efficiency &ndash; plus, you&rsquo;ll make some kickass queries in the process, and that always feels pretty awesome. (I mean, obviously it&rsquo;s not as awesome as going warp speed on the Enterprise, but hey, it&rsquo;s an acceptable alternative.)</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <code>includes</code> method can be chained on to any ActiveRecord model, and takes parameters of an association/table name, passed in as a symbol. Read more about it in the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#eager-loading-associations">Rails docs</a>.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://assets.amuniversal.com/77c6dce06d5c01301d80001dd8b71c47" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<p>It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. It was&hellip;refactoring time! Well it was for me yesterday, at least.</p>

<p>Refactoring your own code has a great payoff at the end, but boy, does it take some work to get there. Something I&rsquo;ve noticed about my own code recently is that I&rsquo;m now able to know that something needs to be refactored pretty easily. I&rsquo;ve been having a lot of gut feelings about parts of my code that just <em>feel</em> wrong, inefficient, and repetitive. The problem is, even though I know where my code is weak, I don&rsquo;t usually know <em>how</em> to go about making my code better.</p>

<p>And this is where making effective use of resources (read: The Art Of Effective Googling) comes quite in handy. Yesterday, however, I used even better resource &ndash; a more experienced developer! We took a look at my code and came up with some ways I could refactor it. I learned about a pretty interesting module that could save me lines of code and keep my application <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>. And now I get to share it with you! This module is called <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/forwardable/rdoc/Forwardable.html">Forwardable</a>, and trust me when I say that it&rsquo;s going to make you want to delegate all the things.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Infatuation With Delegation</h2>

<p>Before we even get to Ruby&rsquo;s Forwardable module, let&rsquo;s first make sure we understand delegation. So, <em>whut</em> exactly is delegation? It&rsquo;s probably exactly what you imagine it to be. In plain English, when you delegate something to someone else, you divide up responsibilities amongst yourselves. For example, if I had someone to delegate all these blog posts to, I wouldn&rsquo;t have to write all of them myself! But I digress; back to programming.</p>

<p>Delegation in programming is not too different. When an object has a lot of responsibilities and things to do, it&rsquo;s generally easier to give some of those responsibilities to another object &ndash; a &ldquo;helper&rdquo; object &ndash; to avoid repetition and keep things working efficiently. Let&rsquo;s put this in some technical context for a hot minute: we can use a technique called <strong>encapsulation</strong> to pack a bunch of functionality into a single object&rsquo;s class and instance methods.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Ok, maybe you&rsquo;re not a fan of technical jargon. Maybe you&rsquo;d much rather prefer a real-life example of delegation? Alright, here you are:

<p>Ugh. You&rsquo;ve probably already recoiled in horror. We have a <code>Book</code> object, which has a <code>language</code>, <code>year</code>, <code>author</code>, and <code>title</code>. And we have a <code>Product</code> object, which creates a new instance of a <code>Book</code> object, and then pretty much repeats all those methods again, using the instance it creates in the <code>initialize</code> method.</p>

<p>We already know this code is bad. But how to go about refactoring it? Use Forwardable, obvs, and do some forwarding! We&rsquo;ll delegate all the handling of information to the <code>Book</code> object. Our <code>Product</code> class doesn&rsquo;t need to worry about that!</p>

<p>Cool. So how do we do this? Like so:</p>

<ul>
<li>Let&rsquo;s first get rid of all of those methods in the <code>Product</code> class. We&rsquo;ll keep our <code>initialize</code> method, since that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ll create a new instance of <code>Book</code> in order to have something that we can call methods on. Now our class looks pretty empty:</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="ruby">class Product 
  def initialize
    @book = Book.new
  end
end
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ll add the Forwardable module, part of the Ruby standard library, by extending it in the first line of the class:</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="ruby">extend Forwardable
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Now we&rsquo;ll specify the methods that we to call on a <code>Book</code> object <em>through</em> our <code>Product</code> class by using the <code>def_delegators</code> method, available through Forwardable:</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="ruby">def_delegators :@book, :language, :year, :author
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>We also want to get the title as well, but we want to rename that method as <code>info</code>. We can use <code>def_delegator</code> in order to do that:</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="ruby">def_delegator :@book, :title, :info
</code></pre>

<p>Now we&rsquo;ve cut down these two classes a lot. Our refactored code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Book
  def language
    "English"
  end

  def year
    "1926"
  end

  def author
    "Ernest Hemingway"
  end

  def title
    "The Sun Also Rises"
  end
end

class Product
  extend Forwardable

  def_delegators :@book, :language, :year, :author
    def_delegator :@book, :title, :info

  def initialize
    @book = Book.new
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>What can this refactored code actually do? Well, it lets us call <code>info</code> on a <code>Product</code> and get back the title of the book! And it allows us to call <code>year</code> directly on an instance of <code>Product</code>:
<code>
p = Product.new
 =&gt; #&lt;Product:0x007feb2183ea78 @book=#&lt;Book:0x007feb2183e9d8&gt;&gt;
p.year
 =&gt; "1926"
p.info
 =&gt; "The Sun Also Rises"
</code></p>

<p>But wait &ndash; we didn&rsquo;t write a <code>year</code> method in the <code>Product</code> class! Well, okay, we <em>kind</em> of did. We used <code>def_delegators</code>, to tell the <code>Product</code> class that it should respond to three methods: <code>language</code>, <code>author</code>, and <code>year</code>. And, we&rsquo;re telling the <code>Product</code> class to respond to each of these methods by calling it on an instance of <code>@book</code>.</p>

<p>And how did we rewrite that <code>title</code> method, exactly? We used <code>def_delegator</code> (singular, not plural!) to tell the <code>Product</code> class to respond to a method called <code>info</code> by calling <code>title</code> on <code>@book</code>. The reason that this works is only because we already have a <code>title</code> method defined on all instances of the <code>Book</code> class.</p>

<h2>Delegate Like You Mean It</h2>

<p>Using the Forwardable module comes in handy not just for refactoring, but also for your initial structuring of an application. Anytime you have an object handling lots of functionality, think about whether you can encapsulate that functionality into another class, and delegate the methods that aren&rsquo;t directly required into that &ldquo;helper&rdquo; class.</p>

<p>There are some great blog posts with examples of how to use the Forwardable module effectively. Here&rsquo;s an implementation on a Reading List class (think Goodreads):
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">def initialize</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">    @books = []</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">end      </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;/</span><span class="n">code</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="sr">/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;p&gt;end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s some pretty bomb stuff happening in such few lines. The <code>ReadingList</code> class gets initialized with an empty array, which we save as an instance variable, <code>@books</code>. Then we&rsquo;ve also our <code>def_delegators</code>, which delegate <code>map</code>, <code>size</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, and <code>shuffle</code> to the <code>@books</code>. And we have two methods that we (kinda) wrote: <code>remove_book</code> and <code>add_book</code>.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of stuff for 9 lines of code! So what can this do, exactly? Well, let&rsquo;s see our reading list in action:
<code>
vaidehis_list = ReadingList.new
 =&gt; #&lt;ReadingList:0x007feb21a6d0b0 @books=[]&gt;
vaidehis_list.add_book('For Whom The Bell Tolls')
 =&gt; ["For Whom The Bell Tolls"]
vaidehis_list.add_book('The Old Man And The Sea')
 =&gt; ["For Whom The Bell Tolls", "The Old Man And The Sea"]
 vaidehis_list.add_book('To Have And To Have Not')
 =&gt; ["For Whom The Bell Tolls", "The Old Man And The Sea", "To Have And To Have Not"]
vaidehis_list.size
 =&gt; 3
vaidehis_list.shuffle
 =&gt; ["For Whom The Bell Tolls", "To Have And To Have Not", "The Old Man And The Sea"]
vaidehis_list.remove_book
 =&gt; "For Whom The Bell Tolls"
vaidehis_list.size
 =&gt;
</code></p>

<p><em>Dayummmmm</em>. Pretty sweet, right? We get to call all these methods directly on our <code>ReadingList</code> class! But what are they actually getting called on? Well, by using <code>def_delegators</code> and <code>def_delegator</code>, we&rsquo;re telling our <code>ReadingList</code> class to call methods like <code>shift</code> and <code>shuffle</code> on our <code>@books</code> instance. And here&rsquo;s where it gets pretty cool: our <code>@books</code> variable is&hellip;an ARRAY.</p>

<p>Just in case you&rsquo;re not as enthused about this fact as I am, let me explain what this means. It means that we can have access to every single method available on an array instance. Just in case you&rsquo;re wondering, all instance of <code>Array</code>s have 113 methods available to them (not including the 54 methods available to all instance of <code>Object</code>)! All we&rsquo;d have to do is add a method (literally, you can choose any method available on an array) like <code>flat_map</code> to our <code>def_delegators</code> line, and tada! It&rsquo;s ours to use on our <code>ReadingList</code> object.</p>

<p>You can see how this can get pretty powerful, pretty fast. In just a few lines of code, we&rsquo;re exercising the functionality of an entire plain old ruby object (PORO), simply by delegating methods through Forwardable.</p>

<p>Okay, that was a lot of refactoring magic. I told you, right? Lots of effort, but lots of payoff! Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I apparently have some books to read.</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Delegation is the idea that an object can delegate a task to an associated &ldquo;helper&rdquo; object.</li>
<li>The Forwardable module uses <code>def_delegators</code> to delegate methods to another Ruby object, and <code>def_delegator</code> to rename a method that&rsquo;s being delegated to another object.</li>
<li>For another example of this module, read this <a href="http://oneofthesedaysblog.com/ruby-day-4-forwardable">incredibly thorough</a> blog post on implementing Forwardable.</li>
