<p>Lesson number one when it comes to developing for the web: everything is just data. When you send something to the server in a request, or when you get something back from the server as a response, all you&rsquo;re really dealing with is data. Simple enough to remember, right? Wrong. Because data can be complicated. Especially when you consider the fact that it has to be passed back and forth in very specific ways. And if you don&rsquo;t format your data correctly, your computer is going to be very, very mad at you (or probably just throw a really unhelpful error message).</p>

<p>I encountered the complications of data formatting the hard way, while trying to pass data between two parts of my application. I wanted to send some data to update a Ruby object in my Postgres database on the server-side, and then I wanted the Rails side to send back an updated response. As if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, I then needed the Ember front end to grab the updated data and immediately render it to the user on the client-side. Data formatting can already be complex when you have only one framework or language; throw in another framework and language, and, well&hellip;you might feel like you&rsquo;re having a little bit of a meltdown.</p>

<p>But fear not! Because here&rsquo;s one awesome thing about data: once you understand the way that it&rsquo;s structured, it&rsquo;s pretty simple to use. And when it comes to working on a more intricate Rails + JavaScript application (like the one I was building recently), there&rsquo;s one kind of data manipulation you&rsquo;re probably going to have to do at some point or another: data serialization. When working with a JavaScript front end, you&rsquo;ll probably have to serialize your data into a <strong>JSON format</strong>, which is short for <em>JavaScript Object Notation</em>. Thankfully, there&rsquo;s a handy gem that makes this so easy that you&rsquo;ll never again question whether or not to serialize your data.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Why Serialize?</h2>

<p>The time has finally come: it&rsquo;s time for us to spiff up our Bookstore application with some JavaScript. (I know, I know, it sounds horrible &ndash; but it&rsquo;ll be so good for our users, I promise). But let&rsquo;s start off simple and keep working with the Rails API we&rsquo;ve been building out.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s pretend for a second that we&rsquo;ve already implemented authentication in our application, which means we have access to the <code>current_user</code> who is logged in at the highest controller level of our application: the <code>ApplicationController</code>. In our <code>UsersController</code>, we want an <code>index</code> action that will be invoked when the <code>current_user</code> logs into their account page. On that page, we&rsquo;ll want to show the user&rsquo;s &ldquo;wish lists&rdquo;, or the list of books that they want to read. Each <code>WishList</code> object belongs to a <code>User</code> and has many <code>Books</code>, and a <code>Book</code> can belong to a <code>WishList</code>. Right now in our controller, we are rendering all the <code>WishLists</code> that are associated with the <code>current_user</code> as JSON:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController
  def index
    @wish_lists = current_user.wish_lists

    render json: @wish_lists
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Cool, we have our <code>WishLists</code> already rendered as JSON. Why serialize anything in that case? I&rsquo;m sure our JSON is structured perfectly well, and that we can convert our Ruby object data into Ember models seamlessly!</p>

<pre><code class="json">[
   {
      "id":43,
      "user":
        {
            "id": 1,
            "username": "Vaidehi"
        },
      "name":"Favorite Shakespeare Plays To Re-Read",
      "created_at":"2015-06-23T21:07:30.108Z",
      "updated_at":"2015-06-23T21:07:30.108Z",
      "books": 
        [
            {
                "id": 24,
                "title": "A Midsummer Night's Dream",
                "author": "William Shakespeare"
            },
            {
                "id": 48,
                "title": "The Tempest",
                "author": "William Shakespeare"
            },
            {
                "id": 13,
                "title": "Much Ado About Nothing",
                "author": "William Shakespeare"
            }
        ]
   }
]
</code></pre>

<p>Oh my. That is <em>definitely</em> not how we want our JSON to look!</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>For one thing, if we give this JSON to Ember, it won&rsquo;t know how to turn it into an Ember model. But there are also some other issues with exactly how this data is structured.</p>

<p>For now, we don&rsquo;t need to render anything to our user about when the created or updated their list, so that&rsquo;s some superfluous data that we shouldn&rsquo;t be requesting from the server.</p>

<p>We also don&rsquo;t want to render anything about our actual <code>User</code> object &ndash; we probably just want to include the <code>user_id</code>, and nothing else. And because we can load the correct <code>Book</code> models via Ember itself, let&rsquo;s not bother with requesting all the details of every <code>Book</code> in our <code>WishList</code>. Instead, let&rsquo;s just get an array of associated <code>book_ids</code>, and then have Ember render the appropriate ones for us from its data store.</p>

<p>So, to serialize or not to serialize? That is the question. And I think you and I both know the answer.</p>

<h2>ActiveModel Serializers</h2>

<p>Before we can get our serializing on, we&rsquo;ll need to add our new favorite gem to our <code>Gemfile</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">gem 'active_model_serializers'
</code></pre>

<p>and then run the <code>bundle</code> command.</p>

<p>Now, we&rsquo;ll want to actually create our serializer, which will work with Rails&#8217; ActiveModel functionality to serialize your persisted Ruby objects into the exact JSON format that we&rsquo;ll specify. Luckily, we can just generate our serializer instead of creating those files:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">rails g serializer wishList
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a <code>serializers</code> directory inside of our top-level <code>/app</code> directory since this is the first serializer we&rsquo;ve generated. And it&rsquo;ll add both an empty <code>application_serializer</code> and a <code>wish_list_serializer.rb</code> file inside of that new directory, which looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class WishListSerializer &lt; ApplicationSerializer
  attributes :id, :name

  has_many :books
  belongs_to :user
end
</code></pre>

<p>The attributes that we&rsquo;ve listed (<code>id</code> and <code>name</code>) are the ones that are <em>whitelisted</em> to be serialized. This basically means that these are the attributes we are allowing the <code>active_model_serializers</code> gem to serialize and make into JSON. The serializer we generated through Rails also recognized the associations that we set up; it created the <code>has_many</code> and <code>belongs_to</code> relationships that we setup inside of our <code>Book</code>, <code>User</code>, and <code>WishList</code> Rails models.</p>

<p>Cool, but how can we check what our data structure looks like? Well, we can start our server (<code>rails server</code>) and then head over to where our index route lives (<code>http://localhost:3000/wish_list</code>). Our JSON response will be rendered through our <code>index</code> action in our <code>WishListsController</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="json">{
    "wish_lists":
        [
            {
                "id":43,
                "name":"Favorite Shakespeare Plays To Re-Read",
                "user":
                    {
                        "id": 1,
                        "username": "Vaidehi"
                    },
                "books":
                    [
                        {
                            "id": 24,
                            "title": "A Midsummer Night's Dream",
                            "author": "William Shakespeare"
                        },
                        {
                            "id": 48,
                            "title": "The Tempest",
                            "author": "William Shakespeare"
                        },
                        {
                            "id": 13,
                            "title": "Much Ado About Nothing",
                            "author": "William Shakespeare"
                        }
                    ]
            }
        ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>Well, our data looks a <em>little</em> bit better. For one thing, our whitelisted attributes and associations have been put under a <code>wish_lists</code> key, which will have an array of <code>WishList</code> objects for the <code>current_user</code>, just as we wrote out in our <code>WishListsController</code>.</p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s great that this gem generated all this for us, and for free, we already know that we&rsquo;re going to have to tweak this a bit. First, let&rsquo;s get rid of that <code>belongs_to :user</code> line, and instead just render a <code>user_id</code> attribute:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class WishListSerializer &lt; ApplicationSerializer
  attributes :id, :name, :user_id

  has_many :books
end
</code></pre>

<p>Because we&rsquo;ve set up the associations in both models, the <code>active_model_serializer</code> will look directly for an <code>id</code> attribute on a <code>User</code> association, and add that as a key in our JSON object, rather than creating a <code>user</code> key that points to an entire JSON <code>User</code> object. What does our JSON object look like now?</p>

<pre><code class="json">{
    "wish_lists":
        [
            {
                "id":43,
                "name":"Favorite Shakespeare Plays To Re-Read",
                "user_id":1,
                "books":
                    [
                        {
                            "id": 24,
                            "title": "A Midsummer Night's Dream",
                            "author": "William Shakespeare"
                        },
                        {
                            "id": 48,
                            "title": "The Tempest",
                            "author": "William Shakespeare"
                        },
                        {
                            "id": 13,
                            "title": "Much Ado About Nothing",
                            "author": "William Shakespeare"
                        }
                    ]
            }
        ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, another step in the right direction. But, what about those annoying <code>Book</code> objects &ndash; how do we turn those objects into just an array of <code>book_ids</code>?</p>

<p>The answer is&hellip;through another serializer, of course! And also some snazzy customization.</p>

<h2>Customizing Your Serializer</h2>

<p>Before we can go about spicing up the JSON response generated by our <code>WishList Serializer</code>, we are going to have to generate a new serializer for our <code>Book</code> objects. Thank goodness we already know how to do all that:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">rails g serializer book
</code></pre>

<p>which will generate a <code>book_serializer.rb</code> file like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class BookSerializer &lt; ApplicationSerializer
  attributes :id, :title, :author

  belongs_to :wish_list
end
</code></pre>

<p>Step one, successfully accomplished! Now, time to bedazzle our serializer. Let&rsquo;s say that the front end of our application doesn&rsquo;t need all that information &ndash; instead, it needs just an array of <code>book_ids</code>. We can just edit our serializer so that we&rsquo;re only using the information that we want to use:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class BookSerializer &lt; ApplicationSerializer
  attributes :id
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now comes step two: telling our <code>WishList Serializer</code> to refer to our <code>BookSerializer</code>, and use <em>that</em> to serialize each book associated with a wish list. If only there was an easy way to do that&hellip;</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class WishListSerializer &lt; ApplicationSerializer
    attributes :id, :name, :user_id, :books

    private
    def books
        BookSerializer.new(object.books).attributes
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Oh, interesting! We&rsquo;ve just created our <em>very own</em> attribute on the <code>WishListSerializer</code>. And what does that method (which is private, because we don&rsquo;t wany any other part of our application to call it) do, exactly? Well, it creates a new instance of our <code>BookSerializer</code>, and runs that serializer for each <code>Book</code> object, returning the attributes that we told it to serializer.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s really awesome about this is that if we suddenly decide that we now want not just an array of <code>ids</code>, but also the <code>title</code> of each <code>Book</code> object, we can just add that attribute into our <code>BookSerializer</code> by modifying the line to <code>attributes :id, :title</code>, and <em>tada</em>! We have an array of <code>Book</code> objects that have both an <code>id</code> <em>and</em> a <code>title</code>. So easy, right?!</p>

<p>The super cool thing about implementing serializers is that our <code>UsersController</code> hasn&rsquo;t changed at all in this process:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController
  def index
    @wish_lists = current_user.wish_lists

    render json: @wish_lists
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>All that&rsquo;s happening now is that Rails is looking for a serializer for our <code>WishList</code> objects on the <code>current_user</code>, and if it finds one (which it will, since we made it!), it uses that to serialize the appropriate data and render it into a JSON format.</p>

<p>Serializers are pretty fantastic because they&rsquo;re easy to generate, customize, and use. In fact, we could even create multiple serializer for the same <em>type</em> of object. We could have a <code>BookDetails Serializer</code>, which might return a ton of information about a book, rather than just its <code>id</code> and <code>title</code>. All we&rsquo;d have to do to use it is specify the serializer within our controller action:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">render json: @books, each_serializer: BookDetailsSerializer
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty amazing stuff, right? This will make integrating our JavaScript front end with our Rails API so much easier. We can serialize all of the things! And then we should probably teach this doggy how to serialize things, too. He&rsquo;s probably confused because he hasn&rsquo;t read this blog post yet:</p>

<p>A week ago, I was on a code overload in Singapore. What was I doing on the other side of the world? Why, giving (and attending!) my very first talk at a Ruby conference, of course!</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to join some serious Ruby powerhouses at the <a href="reddotrubyconf.com">Red Dot Ruby Conference</a> earlier this month. And it was such a cool first conference experience. But, because I had to give a talk, I was pretty preoccupied with writing my speech and creating some fun slides to accompany it. What I forgot in the process was that I would be an audience member at the conference, too! (Pretty silly, I know).</p>

<p>My lightning talk was <a href="http://confreaks.tv/videos/rdrc2015-lightning-talk-refactoring-of-self">just a few minutes</a>, which meant that for the majority of the two-day conference, I had the unique opportunity to listen to some really fantastic talks. And I learned <em>so much</em>. I also got to meet some interesting, talented, and creative people who have made some very significant and core contributions to the Ruby and Rails communities and codebases. Summing up everything that happened in those two days is a bit difficult since every talk was informative in many ways. But I&rsquo;ll recap at least some of the dopest things I learned about while I was there. But if you want the full effect, you should probably <a href="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/_kRtkrBumBw/maxresdefault.jpg">eat a durian</a> while reading this post &ndash; just sayin&#8217;.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Your Code Is Not Just Yours</h2>

<p>One of the first talks of the conference focused on something I pretty much knew nothing about: security. André Arko&rsquo;s talk, <em>Security Is Hard, But We Can&rsquo;t Go Shopping</em> was an eye-opening look at why Ruby developers don&rsquo;t think (or talk) about security vulnerabilities in their codebases &ndash; and why we all <em>should</em> be having that conversation.</p>

<p>André&rsquo;s talk definitely caught my attention when he gave an example of a company that went out of business in a day because they lost <em>all</em> of their data because their severs were hacked. Yes, you read that right: lost all their data, shut down in a day. Pretty terrifying, right?</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHmXar6TNUo?showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
</div>


<p>There were three big takeaways for me from this talk:</p>

<h4><strong>1. Updating is insurance</strong></h4>

<p>We&rsquo;ve all looked at our code and seen deprecation warnings, or things that are out of date and need to be updated to the latest version. And, we&rsquo;ve all, at some point, ignored those warnings. It&rsquo;s really easy to think about shipping your code quickly and iterating fast, particularly because updating things is <em>not</em> fun. And no one wants to do it.</p>

<p>But, you know what&rsquo;s worse? Your entire app blowing up because you had a vulnerability exposed in your code because you didn&rsquo;t update! If we all started thinking about updating as <em>insurance</em>, we&rsquo;d be more willing to sit down and put in the time to make sure all aspects of our applications were updated and thus, at the lowest possible level of security risk. This shift in perspective also seems like the best way to pitch &ldquo;updating&rdquo; as a task to project managers who might not see the time value in something like upgrading an already-functioning application.</p>

<h4>2. <strong>Responsible disclosure</strong></h4>

<p>If you find a security vulnerability, be nice about it. Don&rsquo;t be a jerk, man. Sometimes, you can even get a reward for disclosing! Figure out what the process is for disclosing a security issue to a company, and be empathetic to the developers who wrote that code which you&rsquo;re using &ndash; who knows, maybe one day there&rsquo;ll be a vulnerability in your code, and you&rsquo;ll wish you had been nicer to <em>those</em> developers.</p>

<h4>3. <strong>There are users, there are abusers</strong></h4>

<p>As a young developer, you can think about who is using your code. Many junior developers write code to get it to work or to make it fast, but it&rsquo;s also important to think about who is or could potentially be using your code. It&rsquo;s helpful to start thinking about those things, even as a new programmer. Consider things like strong params and <code>csrf</code> tokens to start, and then work your way up to more complex security measures in your Rails applications. At the end of the day, you probably have some gaping holes in your codebase that is allowing someone to be malicious to your code base, which means that <em>your</em> code isn&rsquo;t actually yours anymore.</p>

<h2>All About That Efficiency</h2>

<p>My favorite talk of the entire conference came from Sam Saffron, the co-founder of Discourse and one of the first employees at StackExchange. To be honest, this talk was less an exercise is learning new things and more a revelation in all the things that I <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> know. And all the things that I knew nothing about centered around one thing: <strong>efficiency</strong>.</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aP5NNkzb4og?showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
</div>


<p>Sam&rsquo;s talk piqued my interested in particular because I&rsquo;ve been trying to think about the efficiency of my own applications for a few weeks now. I&rsquo;ve been trying to use more efficient methods in my own code &ndash; like <code>pluck</code> in last week&rsquo;s post, for example, or my post on the ActiveRecord <code>includes</code> <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/04/07/querying-at-warp-drive-using-activerecord-includes/">method</a> a few months ago.</p>

<p>Yet there&rsquo;s a lot more to efficiency than that, it turns out! And that&rsquo;s exactly what Sam&rsquo;s talk aimed to explore. One of the things I learned pretty early on was that ActiveRecord is inefficient &ndash; yes, really! For those of us writing smaller applications, it may not be all that obvious. But for something much larger, such as Discourse, which has tons and tons of assets that have to compile on page load&hellip;well, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious how even just <em>one</em> n+1 query could throw the whole thing to hell in a handbasket!</p>

<p>What I loved the most about Sam&rsquo;s talk was the live demo. He actually ran his server in showed us the different technologies he used to track things like server calls, method invocations, and raw SQL queries. He didn&rsquo;t just tell us what he used &ndash; he showed us what they looked like in development! And here&rsquo;s the icing on the cake: everything is open source. Which means that we can all use the same technologies and fork them and add/modify them for our own projects!</p>

<p>Here are a few of the gems that Sam uses and recommends, which I&rsquo;ve looked into. Lookout for some upcoming #TechnicalTuesdays posts on these soon:</p>

<h4>1. <code>lru_redux</code></h4>

<p>This gem allows for efficient caching by using ordered arrays. It provides you with some pretty fantastic methods to write, read, and clear your cache. The most important thing here is that arrays are quick and efficient when it comes to looking up an item by index, which makes it ideal for something like storing a cache. Check out more on the <code>lru_redux</code> <a href="https://github.com/SamSaffron/lru_redux">Github page</a>.</p>

<h4>2. <code>dapper</code></h4>

<p>The <code>dapper</code> gem is a lightweight Object Relational Mapper that was created by developers at StackExchange who wanted to solve an n+1 problem. What&rsquo;s pretty cool about this gem is that it allows you to execute raw SQL queries and map your results. A major benefit of this is that you no longer have to rely on the Object-Relational Mapper that comes for free with Rails: ActiveRecord. We&rsquo;ve all encountered ActiveRecord&rsquo;s flaws &ndash; particularly when it comes to calls to the server and queries to the database &ndash; and thanks to this gem, you don&rsquo;t have to deal with those things again. Instead, you can just write your own queries to execute! Find out more over on their <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/dapper-dot-net">ReadMe</a>.</p>

<h4>3. <code>fast_pluck</code></h4>

<p>I&rsquo;m really curious about how this &ldquo;freedom patch&rdquo; actually works, and I need to take the time to sit down and read through it with a good cup of coffee. But, I really like the idea of speeding up ActiveRecord&rsquo;s <code>pluck</code> method, which I am already pretty comfortable with. Check it out over on <a href="https://gist.github.com/SamSaffron/bd593751668e5e5c4afc">this Gist</a>.</p>

<h4>4. <code>memory_profiler</code></h4>

<p>The <code>memory_profiler</code> gem measures how many objects you&rsquo;re allocating to memory on boot of your application, and how many are being retained (how much memory they&rsquo;re taking up) in your app. I haven&rsquo;t explored this gem too much, but I hope to play with it more in the future. You can play with it <a href="

<h2>Language Design Is Hard</h2>

<p>This realization is probably neither prophetic nor profound, but it&rsquo;s still worth repeating nonetheless: languages are hard. They&rsquo;re hard to read, learn, and, most of all, <em>write</em>.</p>

<p>Matz&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqWBB8-iEac">keynote presentation</a> on the new and upcoming features in the next Ruby release was the first time I started thinking about how difficult it must be to actually create the language that we use everyday, and love so dearly. After his presentation, I asked him how he goes about actually designing new features, long before they are implemented. His answer, in short, was incredibly empathetic: he said that he thinks about what it&rsquo;s like to actually use the Ruby language with the feature he has in mind, and he considers the user experience before handing off a feature for someone to actually implement and include in the next release.</p>

<p>I thought about the difficult problem of language design yet again during Paolo Perrotta&rsquo;s awesome talk about refinements. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with the concept (I wasn&rsquo;t before this talk!), the short version is that <strong>refinements</strong> showed up in Ruby 2, and were used to make &ldquo;local&rdquo; monkeypatches, which are a much safer and preferable alternative to global monkeypatching. An interesting issue with refinements is that they rely on dynamic scoping, which means that you can close and reopen the scope of a class and redefine things in different ways.</p>

<div style="text-align:center">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_27-4-dbnA8?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
</div>


<p>In a way, it was great that Paolo&rsquo;s talk was towards the end of the conference, because it tied up things together nicely. I learned that a simple thing like Ruby refinements &ndash; which boils down to two keywords, <code>refine</code> and <code>using</code> &ndash; were a perfect example of the first two things I learned during the conference: security and efficiency!</p>

<p>The issue with refinements is that you can&rsquo;t always tell what&rsquo;s going in your code, or what exactly your code will execute. And that&rsquo;s pretty scary! You know what else it is? A security threat and a huge vulnerability. Refinements  also slow your code down, because the Ruby interpreter has to go through all of your code and check if a refinement is being used or not. Not exactly the most optimized way of doing things, amirite?</p>

<p>All of this got me thinking about the people who write the languages that we use. They have to have a deep understanding of the language architecture and syntax, and think about how a developer might use (or <em>abuse</em>) a language feature. All of this is to say: language design is hard. And maybe we should all be a bit more grateful for the people who think about these complex problems on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Compared to things like security, optimization, and language design, a smelly durian doesn&rsquo;t seem nearly as bad. In fact, I&rsquo;d say that as far as developers go, we as a Ruby community have got it pretty good. But probably not as good as this dog right here:</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Think about the two types of people who use your code: the users, who should have a seamless experience, which will make you optimize your code, and the abusers (or a better term that I can&rsquo;t think of), or those people who will be looking for security vulnerabilities in <em>your</em> code.</li>
<li>Language design is hard. Refinements are a pretty good example of how a programming language can blow your mind with a single feature</li>
<li>I also met Matz! It was <a href="https://twitter.com/vaidehijoshi/status/606684141506076673">incredibly awesome</a>. And he really is as nice as they say.</li>

    <id>http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/06/09/refactoring-to-reveal-rails-group-by</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://img.pandawhale.com/post-10513-Code-Refactoring-Cat-in-Bathtu-U295.gif" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/></p>

<p>There are a lot of opportunities in programming to feel pretty silly about yourself. I&rsquo;m sure that the more coding experience you have, the less often these moments actually occur. But early on in your career, they seem to happen quite often &ndash; or they do to <em>me</em>, at least.</p>

<p>I had one of those moments a couple weeks ago, when I wrote a super long method and then asked a senior developer to take a look at it. While I was writing it, something seemed inherently wrong. I was sure there was a better way to do it, but I guess my Googling skills aren&rsquo;t quite superb yet, because I couldn&rsquo;t find quite the right answer anywhere. It was then that I decided to ask someone who would know exactly which tool to reach for.</p>

<p>What happened next was pretty awesome, albeit slightly depressing. I watched my code be refactored from ten lines down to a single line. It blew my mind &ndash; and not just because I didn&rsquo;t know that this method even <em>existed</em>, but because I wanted to know how it worked! So, I did some digging and learned a bit about the method that I wrote which, as it turns out, already existed: the Rails <code>group_by</code> method on Enumerables.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Data Is For Manipulating</h2>

<p>I started off writing my super long method because I wanted to structure my data in a very specific way. In fact, we&rsquo;ll probably want to structure the data in our Bookstore eCommerce app in a very similar way, too, so let&rsquo;s use that as our working example.</p>

<p>For our admin panel, we want a list of <code>Author</code> objects, categorized by <code>genre</code>. Because our collection of <code>Books</code> is going to grow extensively, it would be helpful for an admin to know which authors are included in a <code>genre</code> or time period. Eventually, this could be used by admins to add new authors by a genre, to filter or sort by a genre, or to calculate an author count per genre, and figure out which authors to add to our collection of books.</p>

<p>Right now, our collection of <code>Author</code> objects isn&rsquo;t very big, but has just enough information for us to start implementing this functionality:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">&gt; Author.all
=&gt; [{#&lt;Author:0x192ajk21a6d0b0 last_name: "Shakespeare", genre: "Renaissance"&gt;}, 
{#&lt;Author:0w917qwl38f6s8v6 last_name: "Homer", genre: "Classics"&gt;}, 
{#&lt;Author:0x390akd23a5d9m4 last_name: "Faulkner", genre: "Southern Gothic"&gt;}, 
{#&lt;Author:1r103aur58b7c4r2 last_name: "Marlowe", genre: "Renaissance"&gt;}]
</code></pre>

<p>Even though our data is easy to read now, we can be sure that it isn&rsquo;t going to stay that way. But we know that if we structure each of our objects correctly, we could have something simple, like this, in our view:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">div
  - Author.sort_by_genre.each do |genre, author|
    h2 = genre
    - author.each do |a|
      p = a.last_name
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of slim, which is what I&rsquo;ve used above, but this view would still be pretty minimal when using another templating language such as erb.</p>

<p>Given that this is the view we want to render, we can use this information to structure our data. I&rsquo;m thinking a hash is the tool for the job, with each key being a <code>genre</code> name, and the value being an array of <code>Author</code> objects that we can iterate through for each specific <code>genre</code>.</p>

<p>It would be nice if we could call something like <code>Author.sort_by_genre</code> and have it return a structure like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">=&gt; {"Renaissance": [Shakespeare, Marlowe], 
"Southern Gothic": [Faulkner], 
"Classics": [Homer]}
</code></pre>

<p>So now that we know what we <em>want</em> our data to look like, let&rsquo;s write it the ugly way, just like I did!</p>

<h2>The First Iteration</h2>

<p>To start with, we know that we want to return a hash. So we can start by instantiating a hash, which will be our <code>authors_by_genre</code>. We also know that we&rsquo;ll need all the <code>Author</code> objects in an array; since we&rsquo;re specifically looking for an author&rsquo;s <code>last_name</code> and <code>genre</code>, we can query for those directly. And we can return our empty hash, since that will eventually be filled up:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">def sort_by_genre
  authors_by_genre = {}
  authors = Author.all.collect { |author| [author.last_name, author.genre] }

  authors_by_genre
end
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, so now we need to fill up our hash. We have our <code>authors</code> variable, which is set to the collection of all <code>Author</code> objects. We will need to iterate through all of them, and put that <code>Author</code> in the correct array for the right <code>genre</code> key. If the right <code>genre</code> key doesn&rsquo;t exist, we&rsquo;ll need to create a key for that author&rsquo;s <code>genre</code>. We can accomplish this with another iteration. Now our method looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Author
  class &lt;&lt; self
    def sort_by_genre
      authors_by_genre = {}
      authors = Author.all.collect { |author| [author.last_name, author.genre] }

      authors.each do |genre, author|
        if authors_by_genre[genre]
          authors_by_genre[genre] &lt;&lt; author
        else
          authors_by_genre[genre] = [author]
        end
      end

      authors_by_genre
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Okay&hellip;so hopefully, by this point, you should be thinking to yourself: <em>This isn&rsquo;t just ugly, it&rsquo;s also <strong>super</strong> inefficient</em>. And you&rsquo;d be right. It&rsquo;s pretty bad.</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/asIa0FVaBSQNO" width="480" height="307" frameBorder="0" style="max-width: 100%" class="giphy-embed" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p><br></p>

<p>If you weren&rsquo;t sure how bad it really is, think about all the queries we&rsquo;re making! And how many times we&rsquo;re iterating! As soon as I finished writing this and got it working, I knew it was <em>definitely</em> not the right approach. But the first step is to get it working. Now, we need to seriously consider how we can make it right and make it fast.</p>

<p>You know what what this means, right? Refactoring time.</p>

<h2>Group All The Things</h2>

<p>A quick way to refactor some of the messiness from our first iteration is by first changing how we initialize our hash object, and also modifying how we go about deciding whether to create a new key or add to a key that already exists.</p>

<p>Enter the <code>each_with_object</code> method! This is a pretty rad method I learned about while refactoring my first iteration of this <code>sort_by_genre</code> method. The <code>each_with_object</code> method requires a single argument: the object that you want to pass to it in each iteration. In our case, we&rsquo;ll pass it a hash. And since the items we want to actually &ldquo;categorize&rdquo; are our <code>Author</code> objects, we&rsquo;ll call <code>each_with_object</code> on our collection of <code>Authors</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Author
  class &lt;&lt; self
    def sort_by_genre
      Author.all.each_with_object({}) {  }
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now, what about that block &ndash; what goes inside? Well, we can think about what we want to do with each of our <code>Author</code> objects that we&rsquo;re iterating over. Inside of our hash, which we&rsquo;re passing explicitly as an argument to <code>each_with_object</code>, we want to either find the correct key and put the correct <code>Author</code> into that array, or create a new key based on the current <code>Author</code> object&rsquo;s genre. We can write that quite nicely by using the <code>||=</code> <strong>or equals</strong> operator, which will assign a new object, or whatever is to the right of the operator, equal to the left side of the pipes, or whatever is to the left of the operator:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Author
  class &lt;&lt; self
    def sort_by_genre
      Author.all.each_with_object({}) { 
      |author, hash| (hash[author.genre]
      ||= []) &lt;&lt; author }
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Much better, right? In this second iteration, we&rsquo;re passing a hash directly to the <code>each_with_object</code> method, and basically telling it, <em>Find the key in the hash I just passed you that is equal to this author&rsquo;s genre. And if no such key exists, make one, set it equal to an empty array, and then put this current author into that array</em>.</p>

<p>The order of our or equals operator is particularly important, because if it were switched, it would never run what is on the right side of the pipes. The <code>||=</code> operator is exactly like the <code>||</code> operator in that it will run what is to its right <em>only</em> if what is to its left evaluates to <code>false</code>. This is what keeps our method from trying to create multiple keys again and again, and instead forces it to find an existing key first. The super cool thing about the <code>||=</code> operator is that it is actually assigning a new key value to an empty array, which cuts out a lot of extra lines we had in our first iteration!</p>

<p>Okay, so this second iteration has been a vast improvement. But I think it&rsquo;s time for some serious refactoring magic. Are you ready? Okay. This <em>entire</em> method can be rewritten into a single, simple line:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Author
  class &lt;&lt; self
    def sort_by_genre
      Author.all.group_by(&amp;:genre)
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Yup. I kid you not.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>This is the magic of the Rails <code>group_by</code> method, which collects an enumerable into sets, grouping it by the result of a block. This method takes a proc using the ampersand shortcut as an argument (which we started using last week!). The <code>group_by</code> method is passed the symbol <code>:genre</code>, which is an attribute on each <code>Author</code> object, and corresponds to a <code>genre</code> column in the <code>authors</code> table. So, we are effectively grouping all of our <code>Author</code> objects by the result of calling <code>.genre</code> on each object. In other words, we&rsquo;re grouping by the <code>genre</code> attribute since the attribute corresponds to an <code>attr_accessor</code> method in the class.</p>

<p>And now, if we call our <code>sort_by_genre</code> class method, we get the exact data structure we were hoping for:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">&gt; Author.sort_by_genre
=&gt; {"Renaissance": [{#&lt;Author:0x192ajk21a6d0b0 last_name: "Shakespeare", genre: "Renaissance"&gt;}, 
{#&lt;Author:1r103aur58b7c4r2 last_name: "Marlowe", genre: "Renaissance"&gt;}], 
"Southern Gothic": [{#&lt;Author:0x390akd23a5d9m4 last_name: "Faulkner", genre: "Southern Gothic"&gt;}], 
"Classics": [{#&lt;Author:0w917qwl38f6s8v6 last_name: "Homer", genre: "Classics"&gt;}]}
</code></pre>

<p>Hooray! Or maybe not hooray. Maybe instead of hooray, you feel like I did when I realized that you could refactor all of this into one line:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">PROGRAMMING:&#10;Write a 10-line method.&#10;Feel proud when it works.&#10;Find out you can write the same thing in a single line.&#10;Cry in the corner.</p>&mdash; Vaidehi Joshi (@vaidehijoshi) <a href="https://twitter.com/vaidehijoshi/status/601156228723642369">May 20, 2015</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p><br></p>

<p>Although it made me feel pretty silly, the actual process of writing the <code>group_by</code> method from scratch was a really great learning experience. I ended up using the examples above in a talk I gave on refactoring at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/reddotrubyconf">Red Dot Ruby Conference</a> in Singapore last week. And I actually recreated the <em>exact same</em> functionality when I had to write my <em>own</em> <code>groupBy</code> function in JavaScript for a React component I had to build! I guess that however deep of a rabbit hole refactoring can be, sometimes it&rsquo;s exactly the right kind of deep dive you need to learn how something works under the hood. I still totally feel like that cat in the bathtub whenever I do it &ndash; but I&rsquo;m kind of okay with that.</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <code>group_by</code> method takes a block, which it uses to group a collection of objects. The <code>each_with_object</code> method takes an object as an argument, and a block which tells it how to sort the collection you call the method upon.</li>
<li>Read more on the <code>group_by</code> method in the <a href="http://apidock.com/rails/Enumerable/group_by">Rails docs</a>, which also has a great example!</li>
<li>Looking for another example of how to implement Rails&#8217; <code>group_by</code> in a view? Check out <a href="https://ariejan.net/2007/01/12/rails-group-results-by-week-using-group_by/">this blog post</a>.</li>
<li>Did you know that Ruby also has a similar <code>group_by</code> method? It&rsquo;s great when you want to <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Enumerable.html#method-i-group_by">return a hash</a> where the keys are evaluated by a block!</li>

<p>There aren&rsquo;t too many things that bring me down when I&rsquo;m deep into programming. But there&rsquo;s always one thing that&rsquo;ll stop me dead in my tracks: a code smell. In the context of programming, a code smell is something that tells you that your code is&hellip;well, a bit <em>off</em>.</p>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;ve been programming for months or for decades, you&rsquo;ll run into &ldquo;code that smells&rdquo; again and again. Except the better that you get, you&rsquo;ll anticipate your code smelling, or before you even write it, you&rsquo;ll know that it&rsquo;s going to stink. For me, a lot of my code that tends to smell are sections where I&rsquo;ve duplicated what I&rsquo;ve written, which is to say that I&rsquo;ve written something that&rsquo;s identical or at least very, very similar to another piece of code in my application. I&rsquo;ve noticed that I&rsquo;ve started catching myself as I write duplicated code, which is a sign that I&rsquo;m getting better as a developer &ndash; hooray!</p>

<p>But, there are a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell#Common_code_smells">common code smells</a>, and I definitely still can&rsquo;t catch all of them in my own code. Generally, if any part of your program has a common code smell, it&rsquo;s a sign that you need to rethink how your system is structured on a deeper level, and that it&rsquo;s probably time to start refactoring.</p>

<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve noticed that I&rsquo;ve been sniffing out the same issue in my code: long methods. So I did a bit of investigating and found that there are some cool ways to shorten up your longer methods. Thanks to Ruby magic, we have easy access to methods like <code>to_proc</code> in the form of &ldquo;ampersand and object&rdquo;, or the <strong>&amp;:</strong> syntax. If you have no clue what those are, don&rsquo;t worry. I didn&rsquo;t either! Until I wrote this post, obvs.</p>

<h2>A Slim Method Is A Beautiful Method</h2>

<p>In our eCommerce bookstore app, we&rsquo;re storing our <code>Order</code> <code>amount</code> totals as BigDecimals. You might remember why BigDecimals <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/02/10/money-makes-the-world-go-round-using-money-rails-and-bigdecimal/">are better than floats</a> when it comes to performing accurate monetary calculations. But even though we&rsquo;re using BigDecimal on the backend, there may be times when we want to convert our decimals back into floats. Like what if we want to start integrating a JavaScript frontend? (yes, I went there). The point is, we should be able to do something like that pretty easily, especially if we wanted to serialize and return a JSON object that has the correct object type.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d probably start by iterating through all of our order amounts and turn them into floats, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Order
    class &lt;&lt; self
        def amounts_to_floats
            Order.all.map do |order|
                order.amount.to_f
            end
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Well, it does the job. But&hellip;it doesn&rsquo;t look so great, does it? Let&rsquo;s cut it down:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Order
    class &lt;&lt; self
        def amounts_to_floats
            Order.all.map {|order| order.amount.to_f }
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s make it a little fancier and throw in the <code>pluck</code> method, which will query for only the to grab <em>only</em> an <code>Order</code>&rsquo;s <code>amount</code>?</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Order
    class &lt;&lt; self
        def amounts_to_floats
            Order.pluck(:amount).map {|amount| amount.to_f }
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>I guess it&rsquo;s better, but still not as good as it could be. Are you thinking what I&rsquo;m thinking? There&rsquo;s <em>gotta</em> be a better way!</p>

<p><img src="http://provensal.com/lbb/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/better_way.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<h2>A Proc And An Object Walk Into A Bar&hellip;</h2>

<p>As is the case with most things in programming, if we wish for a better way to do something, we can generally assume that there is! And in our case, the better way to do it is by using something called <strong>ampersand and object</strong>.</p>

<p>And we can implement it on our <code>amounts_to_floats</code> method like so:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Order
    class &lt;&lt; self
        def amounts_to_floats
            Order.pluck(:amount).map(&amp;:to_f)
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The result of this will be the exact same thing as the <code>map</code> we wrote above:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">&gt; Order.amounts_to_floats
=&gt; [210.99, 150.5, 24.99, 391.99, 120.25]
</code></pre>

<p>So, what happened here? Well, let&rsquo;s just start with what we know for sure.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We took all the <code>Order</code> objects and queried for just their <code>amounts</code>, which are in <code>BigDecimal</code> format.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>pluck</code> method returns an array of the attributes that you query for, so, which would mean that our array would look something like this:
<code>[#&lt;BigDecimal:7f87ed12b2f0,'0.21099E3',18(18)&gt;, #&lt;BigDecimal:7f87ed121700,'0.1505E3',18(18)&gt;, #&lt;BigDecimal:7f87ed119348,'0.2499E2',18(18)&gt;...]</code></p></li>
<li><p>Okay, so then we mapped over all of these amounts, right? And somehow we called <code>.to_f</code> on all of them. Which returned the array that we were hoping for:
<code>[210.99, 150.5, 24.99, 391.99, 120.25]</code></p></li>
</ol>


<p>All of this begs one question: how on earth did the <code>&amp;</code> (ampersand) know to call <code>to_f</code> on each of our objects? And how did <code>map</code> know what to do with the ampersand that we passed it?</p>

<p>Time to find out.</p>

<p>Whenever something seems super daunting, I go back to the basics. Which is exactly what I think we should do here, too. We can all agree that in Ruby is an object, right? And methods are how we send messages to objects. With that in mind, let&rsquo;s look back at that confusing line of code:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Order.pluck(:amount).map(&amp;:to_f)
</code></pre>

<p>We know <code>Order.pluck(:amount)</code> to be an array &ndash; it&rsquo;s an object, which means it&rsquo;s the <em>receiver</em> of our method. That means that <code>.map</code> is our method. And <code>map</code> has been passed <code>&amp;:to_f</code>, which seems to have replaced the usual <code>do end</code> or <code>{}</code> blocks that generally accompany the <code>map</code> iterator.</p>

<p>At this point, if you&rsquo;re thinking that the <code>&amp;</code> ampersand is responsible for executing that <code>to_f</code> method on each of the elements of the array, you&rsquo;re definitely onto something.</p>

<p>In fact, the <code>&amp;</code> calls <em>another</em> method on the object: <code>to_proc</code>. The ampersand calls <code>to_proc</code> on whatever comes after it. In our case, it&rsquo;s the <code>to_f</code>. But it&rsquo;s not just the plain old method <code>to_f</code> &ndash; it&rsquo;s actually the <em>symbol</em>, <code>:to_f</code>.</p>

<p>And we can double check this by looking at <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Symbol.html#method-i-to_proc">the Ruby docs</a>! The <code>to_proc</code> method is defined on the <code>Symbol</code> class:</p>

<blockquote><p><code>to_proc</code> Returns a Proc object which responds to the given method by sym.</p></blockquote>

<p>So all the <code>&amp;</code> is doing is: <code>:to_f.to_proc</code>. It turns the symbol into a proc, and whatever object you pass to it, it&rsquo;ll call that method on that object. You&rsquo;re basically telling the <code>map</code> function, <em>Hey, I already have this method I want to call on every single item you&rsquo;re iterating over. So when you invoke yourself on the receiving object, run this code that I&rsquo;m passing you.</em></p>

<p>Because <code>:to_f</code> isn&rsquo;t actually a block, the ampersand tries to make it a block by calling <code>to_proc</code> on it. This means that you can pass any method to <code>&amp;</code> in symbol form, and it will convert it to and invoke that proc.</p>

<p>But what if you didn&rsquo;t want to pass it a defined method in Ruby as a symbol? What if, instead, you wanted to write your own block and pass it to <code>&amp;</code> explicitly? That would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">half_off_sale = Proc.new { |amount| amount/2 }

Order.pluck(:amount).map &amp;half_off_sale
=&gt; [#&lt;BigDecimal:7f87ec20e4c0,'0.105495E3',18(45)&gt;, #&lt;BigDecimal:7f87ec20e3d0,'0.7525E2',18(45)&gt;, #&lt;BigDecimal:7f87ec20e2e0,'0.12495E2',18(45)&gt;...]
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty cool, right? In this case, we created a <code>half_off_sale</code> proc, that we passed directly to the ampersand. The <code>&amp;</code> didn&rsquo;t have to make it a proc (meaning that it didn&rsquo;t have to invoke <code>to_proc</code>) since we already passed it one. So when <code>map</code> iterated through all the amounts, it yielded to our <code>half_off_sale</code> proc, and ran that code on every single element in our array of amounts.</p>

<p>As you can see, the ampersand and object and <code>to_proc</code> methods can be pretty powerful &ndash; particularly when they&rsquo;re combined into this handy little shortcut! That doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to use them all the time, but if you understand the fundamentals of how they work, they can really help clean up your code, especially when it&rsquo;s pretty smelly.</p>

<p>This is just a primary introduction to the concepts of ampersand and object and <code>to_proc</code>. There&rsquo;s definitely a lot more to them, and they can get quite complicated. I&rsquo;m still learning about them myself! But, I&rsquo;m going to keep reading about how procs work and, hopefully, there&rsquo;ll be a forthcoming Technical Tuesdays post about how to pass methods to procs! Until then, keep sniffin&#8217; out those code smells, my friends!</p>

<p>When it comes to databases, there are generally two schools of thought. There are those people who love them, and there are those people who just hate them. While I wholeheartedly admit that I belong to the former camp of believers, I can understand why someone would subscribe to the latter group. Databases are hard! They&rsquo;re beautiful and super fun once you understand how to manipulate them, but until you get to that point, they&rsquo;re pretty much just hard.</p>

<p>I think that a large part of what makes databases hard to understand is the sheer amount of things you can do with the data it contains. Between database migrations, which we unpacked <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/05/19/the-secret-life-of-your-database-part-1-migrations/">last week</a>, and writing SQL queries that actually do what you want them to do, it&rsquo;s really easy to just throw your hands up in the air and give up completely. But, you shouldn&rsquo;t! And I hope that, after reading this post, you won&rsquo;t! Because <em>databases are beautiful</em> (that should be on a t-shirt somewhere), and you just have to get to know them a little bit.</p>

<p>So, what should we get to know about them? Well, the scariest part, of course: <strong>join tables</strong>. Join tables are used to combine two sets of data from two different tables. Depending on what you query the database for, different values can be returned. No matter the size of your application, you&rsquo;re probably going to have at least a few tables, and usually many more. Most of the time, the data in a single table by itself isn&rsquo;t super useful; when it&rsquo;s combined with another database&rsquo;s information, however, then things really get cooking. Join tables are how we get specific information from two different datasets (or two different database tables). There are seven different types of join tables, but there are three in particular that I&rsquo;ve encountered time and again. Let&rsquo;s explore the differences between inner joins, left outer joins, and right outer joins.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Know Thy Data</h2>

<p>Before we get too deep into join syntax, let&rsquo;s take a look at our data! We&rsquo;ll stick with the schema from our eCommerce bookstore application. Since we don&rsquo;t have any real users yet, we can just populate our database with some fake, super fun seed data.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: I may or may not have gotten carried away when making the seed data. Anyways, here&rsquo;s what our databases look like:
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/voemAen.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll be working with the same two tables: a <code>Users</code> table, and an <code>Orders</code> table. Each <code>User</code> instance has a <code>first_name</code> and a <code>last_name</code> (and realistically speaking, probably a bunch of other attributes&hellip;but let&rsquo;s keep it simple for now).</p>

<p>Each <code>Order</code> object <code>belongs_to</code> a <code>User</code>, which means it has a <code>user_id</code> column to store the foreign key from the <code>Users</code> table. Each <code>Order</code> also has a unique, randomly-generated <code>number</code> (think order confirmation number), and an order <code>total</code>, which is stored as a <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/02/10/money-makes-the-world-go-round-using-money-rails-and-bigdecimal/">Ruby BigDecimal object</a>.</p>

<h2>Inner Joins</h2>

<p>The most common and easiest join table syntax to understand is the <em>inner join</em>. Inner joins are our tool of choice if we&rsquo;re looking for a specific set of data that only matches the parameters we identify in our query.</p>

<p>For example, say we&rsquo;re looking for a subset of data that shows <em>only</em> <code>users</code> with <code>orders</code>. We&rsquo;re not interested in any <code>Users</code> that haven&rsquo;t placed an order; we only want the data of a <code>User</code> that actually <em>has</em> placed an order. This is a set of data that might be useful for something like an admin panel that we might want to build out in our next feature, so let&rsquo;s return just some basic information right now, like the <code>User</code>&rsquo;s <code>last_name</code> and their <code>user_id</code>.</p>

<p>So, what would that look like in a SQL query? Well, we know that we want to select only the <code>last_name</code> and the <code>id</code> of the <code>User</code> instance. But, we don&rsquo;t want ALL <code>Users</code> by their <code>ids</code>; we actually want only the <code>Users</code> that are associated with an <code>user_id</code> on an <code>Order</code>. So, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll select:</p>

<pre><code class="sql">SELECT users.last_name, orders.user_id
FROM users
</code></pre>

<p>Cool, we&rsquo;re halfway there. Now for the join. Let&rsquo;s think for a second&hellip;we want to <em>join</em> the data in our <code>Users</code> table with the data in our <code>Orders</code> table. And, we want to match the rows by <code>ids</code>. What does that mean, exactly? Well, it means that we only want to return an <code>User</code> row where that <code>User's</code> <code>id</code> exists in a row of the <code>Order</code> database, where it&rsquo;ll be under the <code>user_id</code> foreign key column. We&rsquo;ll also order our data by the <code>Order's</code> <code>id</code> for now, but we&rsquo;ll change that as we play around a bit more. So let&rsquo;s add all that to our query:</p>

<pre><code class="sql">SELECT users.last_name, orders.user_id
FROM users
INNER JOIN orders
ON users.id=orders.user_id
ORDER BY orders.id;
</code></pre>

<p>And if we run this query, what&rsquo;ll happen? We&rsquo;ll get this fabulousness:
<br><br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/sWlj3zx.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<p>Nice! So, we get five records returned to us, and it returns exactly what we asked for: the <code>User's</code> <code>last_name</code> and the <code>Order's</code> <code>user_id</code>. But there are some <code>User</code> instances that are there twice, and one of the <code>Users</code> (which is apparently T.S. Eliot) doesn&rsquo;t even show up in our records!</p>

<p>If we take a closer look at our <code>Orders</code> database table, that&rsquo;s exactly what we should <em>expect</em> to happen. The <code>User</code> with an <code>id</code> of <code>1</code> placed two <code>Orders</code>, so there are two records with his <code>last_name</code> and <code>id</code> that are returned to us. And Eliot, who hasn&rsquo;t placed any <code>Orders</code> yet, isn&rsquo;t returned to us at all! That makes sense though, since we&rsquo;re asking for a subset of information &ndash; only the rows that fit the requirements of our query &ndash; or, the inner information of our database, and nothing superfluous, meaning that all the outer, extra information is ignored.</p>

<h2>Left Outer Joins</h2>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve covered the relatively easier inner join, it&rsquo;s time to get to the slightly trickier stuff: outer joins! Outer joins come in two shapes and sizes: <strong>left outer joins</strong> and <strong>right outer joins</strong>. The concept behind the two is fundamentally the same, but they kind of work like opposites. Let&rsquo;s look at a left
outer join to start.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say that our admins actually want to see all the <code>Users</code> at once in the admin panel, regardless of whether they&rsquo;ve placed an order or not. This means that we want to widen our data query to ALL <code>Users</code>, and all the <code>Orders</code> associated with any of those <code>Users</code>. We&rsquo;ll begin our SQl query the same way as before, selecting the <code>User's</code> <code>last_name</code>.</p>

<p>But our admin&rsquo;s also want to see the <code>Order</code> <code>totals</code> for each <code>User</code> &ndash; if the <code>User</code> has placed an order, obviously. So, we&rsquo;ll add that to our select statement as well.</p>

<pre><code class="sql">SELECT users.last_name, orders.total
FROM users
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we want to join our <code>Users</code> table with our <code>Orders</code> table again. Except this time, we don&rsquo;t want to do an inner join. Instead, we want all the data from our <code>Users</code> table, and any data that might correspond to all of our <code>Users</code> from the <code>Orders</code> database. We&rsquo;ll still do something similar to before and join our tables on the <code>id</code> columns, but we&rsquo;ll order by each <code>User's</code> <code>id</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="sql">SELECT users.last_name, orders.total
FROM users
LEFT OUTER JOIN orders
ON users.id=orders.user_id
ORDER BY users.id;
</code></pre>

<p>If we look at our data, we&rsquo;ll remember that the <code>User</code> with an <code>id</code> of <code>4</code> never placed any orders! How might this affect what data is returned to us? Let&rsquo;s run our query and find out:</p>

<p><br><br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/STqLeW3.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<p>Whoa! Since our <code>User</code> T.S. Eliot never placed an order, he didn&rsquo;t have any row in the <code>Orders</code> database that corresponded to him. Because there was no <code>Order</code> <code>total</code> column that was attributed to his <code>id</code>, what got returned instead? <code>NULL</code>!</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what outer joins will do if they don&rsquo;t find anything! If there is no match on the right table that is being &ldquo;joined&rdquo; (in our case, the <code>Orders</code> database), the default return value will always be <code>NULL</code>. Now that we know that&hellip;how do you think that a right outer join might work?</p>

<h2>Right Outer Joins</h2>

<p>A <strong>right outer join</strong> is almost the same as a left outer join. The difference is that the table that you&rsquo;re joining is on the <em>right</em>. What does that mean for your return set of data?</p>

<p>Well, it means that all the data on the <em>right</em> table will be returned &ndash; even if it doesn&rsquo;t have a corresponding value. Our query might look something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="sql">SELECT orders.number, orders.total
FROM users
RIGHT OUTER JOIN orders
ON users.id=orders.user_id
ORDER BY orders.id;
</code></pre>

<p>Here, we are ordering by the <code>Order's</code> <code>id</code>, and we&rsquo;re only looking at the <code>Order</code> <code>number</code> and <code>total</code>. When we run our query, this is what we&rsquo;ll get:</p>

<p><br><br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/LJoNd8I.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<p>In our case, our data doesn&rsquo;t look super different with a right outer join. In fact, it looks a lot like the inner join we started with! So why do right inner joins matter, then?</p>

<p>Well, what if our admins change their minds (again!) and instead want ONLY orders to be returned. And what if you have an order that doesn&rsquo;t have a <code>User</code>, because that user deleted their account? Well, in that case, our <code>Order</code> would still show up in the returned data, and if we selected the corresponding <code>User</code> <code>ids</code>, then the deleted <code>User</code> would have a <code>NULL</code> <code>id</code> value! Pretty cool, right?</p>

<p>See, databases can be pretty awesome once you understand a little bit about how they work! In fact, I love them so much that I give &lsquo;em two thumbs way, way up!</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Join tables allow us to combine two different sets of data. You can make your data subset be as specific or broad as you want, depending on what you query for!</li>
<li>An inner join will only return values that exist in both tables.</li>
<li>A left outer join will return all the values from the left database, and any values that correspond from the right database. A right outer join will return all the values from the right database, and any values that correspond form the left. Any values that don&rsquo;t have a corresponding row will be returned as <code>NULL</code>.</li>
