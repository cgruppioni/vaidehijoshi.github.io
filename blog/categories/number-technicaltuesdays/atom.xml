    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, I had my first full-day technical interview. It was a thrilling experience, and so much more fun than I expected. Part of that was because I viewed the whole experience not as an evaluation, but rather an opportunity to learn as much as I could from experienced developers. I also knew that, irrespective of whether I did well or not, I&rsquo;d learn some new technologies and tricks. And boy, was that the truth.</p>

<p>I left the interview with a long list of things I&rsquo;d never heard of (<em>why hello, blog posts for the next five Tuesdays!</em>), one of which included the use of decorators in Rails. I was actually kind of surprised that I had never encountered decorators while building my own Rails apps, but it turns out that these are actually pretty advanced topics and there&rsquo;s a good amount of <a href="https://bibwild.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/the-simplest-rails-decorator-implementation-that-just-might-work/">debate on how and when to use decorators</a>, and <a href="http://thepugautomatic.com/2014/03/draper/">whether or not they&rsquo;re actually useful</a>.</p>

<p>But hey, none these discussions apply or make any sense unless you know <em>what</em> a decorator actually is. So, let&rsquo;s find out!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a well-known fact that your Rails model should be fat, and your controllers should be skinny. But what about your views? Well, there are varying schools of thought on the MVC framework and how it should function. Steve Klabnik <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2011-12-30-active-record-considered-harmful">argued that views should have no logic</a>, stating that otherwise &ldquo;They&rsquo;re hard to test, they&rsquo;re hard to read, and it&rsquo;s not just a slippery slope, but a steep one. Things go downhill rapidly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I really liked the way that John Otander described how views should function in <a href="http://johnotander.com/rails/2014/03/07/decorators-on-rails/">his blog post on decorators</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Your views should be stupid. I like to use the analogy that views should read similarly to a shopping list. There shouldn&rsquo;t be any complexity or logic.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>I decided to look back at <a href="https://flatiron-cabbie.herokuapp.com/">Cabbie</a>, one of my first projects, and check out the shape of my own views. This app basically was a review system (think Yelp) for New York City cab drivers. We had models such as Users, Drivers, Reviews, etc.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a taste of our driver show page:</p>

<p>&#8220;`erb</p>

<div class="driver-info">
  <%= @driver.medallion_number %>
  <% if @driver.medallion_number.length == 4 %>
    Medallion Number: <%= @driver.medallion_number %>
  <% else %>
    License Number: <%= @driver.medallion_number %>
  <% end %>
</div>


<p>&#8220;`</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much the face I made when I looked at this code with a fresh set of eyes. This is one tiny little snippet of code, but imagine many more conditionals and much more logic in this view, and you get the idea. Not a pretty picture.</p>

<p>A couple things seemed problematic about this code:</p>

<ol>
<li>The first problem was that the view had to do the logic of figuring out whether a driver had a four-digit medallion number (NYC taxi) or a longer medallion number (an Uber driver). How could we fix this? Well, we could abstract this into a method in the class.</li>
<li>The second problem: why is it the <code>Driver</code> object&rsquo;s job to keep track of this? Do we really need a helper method in this case? All we really need this logic for is in rendering the view. We could make it its own class that inherits from the Driver class, maybe?</li>
<li>Ok, the third problem: we know what we want &ndash; a <code>Driver</code> object that has some special functionality when it comes to presenting it in the view. But how do we get it? We want to extend the behavior of the <code>Driver</code> class purely for decorative purposes. Sounds like a job for a <strong>decorator</strong>!</li>
</ol>


<p>So, what is a decorator, you might ask? Well, firstly, it&rsquo;s actually known as the <strong>decorator pattern</strong>. An aspect of object-oriented programming, decorators allow you to add functionality to an object, but also retains all the other methods that belong to that object&rsquo;s class. It&rsquo;s a great tool to use when you want to implement and/or encapsulate certain methods that are only used in the view, and yet still have access to all the other properties of that object.</p>

<p>The best way to learn what a decorator does is to try and use it yourself and see what happens. I implemented my decorator on my Cabbie app, using the <a href="https://github.com/drapergem/draper">Draper gem</a>.</p>

<p>First, you&rsquo;ll want to make sure you add <code>gem 'draper'</code> to your Gemfile.</p>

<p>Next, you&rsquo;ll want to generate the decorator for whatever object you want to &lsquo;decorate&rsquo;. In my case, I wanted to implement it on the driver object, so I typed <code>rails generate decorator Driver</code> into my terminal.</p>

<p>Then, add <code>.decorate</code> to your object in the appropriate controller. Here&rsquo;s how I did it in my <code>DriversController</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class DriversController &lt; ApplicationController

  def show
    @driver = Driver.find(params[:id]).decorate
  end

  def search
    @driver = Driver.find_by(:medallion_number =&gt; params[:medallion_number].upcase).decorate
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p>After generating your decorator, you&rsquo;ll notice that there&rsquo;s a new directory in your <code>/app</code> file called <code>decorators</code>. Nothing to be scared of here: it&rsquo;s just a class that inherits from the Draper Decorator gem. Here&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll add any additonal functionality you want your &lsquo;decorated&rsquo; object to have.</p>

<p>In my case, I wanted to abstract away the Driver&rsquo;s medallion/license number away and encapsulate it into a method. I created an <code>id_number</code> method in my decorator file:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class DriverDecorator &lt; Draper::Decorator
  delegate_all

  def id_number
    if medallion_number.length == 4
      "Medallion Number: #{medallion_number}"
    else
      "License Number: #{medallion_number}"
    end
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, you still with me? Here&rsquo;s the satisfying part. Cut out all that ridiculous erb from your view &ndash; we don&rsquo;t need that anymore! Instead, we&rsquo;ll just call on the decorator method that we wrote for exactly this purpose. Ready? Okay. Let&rsquo;s do this:</p>

<p>&#8220;`erb</p>

<div class="driver-info">
  <%= @driver.id_number %>
</div>


<p>&#8220;`</p>

<p>LOOK. AT. THAT. No iterations. No <code>if</code>/<code>elsif</code>/<code>end</code> keywords. One method, being called on exactly one object. No logic at all. You can read this and know exactly what we&rsquo;re trying to render. <em>Beautiful</em>.</p>

<p>As lovely as this looks, it&rsquo;s also important to keep in mind that this is an advanced topic and not always necessary. Only use decorators if they&rsquo;ll actually clean up your code and be helpful.</p>

<p>And on that note, there&rsquo;s only one thing left to do: Get tidying, kids!</p>

<ul>
<li>Using a decorator isn&rsquo;t always the right answer. Make sure you&rsquo;re comfortable with the MVC framework and that you really need to use a decorator before you go about implementing one.</li>

    <link href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/01/06/the-final-countdown-using-javascripts-setinterval-plus-clearinterval-methods/"/>

    <id>http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/01/06/the-final-countdown-using-javascripts-setinterval-plus-clearinterval-methods</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s a brand new year, and with that comes a renewed sense of self. Also: a rather lengthy todo list. Enter <strong>#technicaltuesdays</strong>, or my attempt at beefing up my technical chops by posting a blog post every week &mdash; specifically on Tuesdays, in case it wasn&rsquo;t obvious. (Sorry, Thursday, you were a close second, but you just didn&rsquo;t make the cut.)</p>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s on the menu this week? JavaScript! New year = new me, you guys. Actually, some of my technical interviews have been a bit JavaScript-heavy, so I&rsquo;ve been stepping up my curly bracket game.</p>

<p>In honor of the new year, I wanted to use JavaScript to create a quick &ldquo;New Year&rsquo;s Countdown&rdquo; function. Suffice it to say, <em>it was neither quick nor easy</em>. But I learned about two cool timing events in JavaScript &ndash; <strong>setInterval</strong> and <strong>clearInterval</strong> &ndash; and now you can learn about them, too!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<h2>setInterval()</h2>

<p>Okay, so what exactly was my goal with this function? I wanted to it to countdown from 10 to 1 and then print out &ldquo;Happy New Year!&rdquo;. JavaScript has a couple different time events, but the trick is figuring out which one works best for your purposes.</p>

<p>I first started off trying to use the setTimeout() method, which waits a certain amount of time before executing the function that you pass it as a parameter. I was stuck for a long time trying to figure out how to get my code to execute again after every second. I quickly realized that this method wasn&rsquo;t the best tool for the job.</p>

<p>Luckily, one method did just the trick: <strong>setInterval()</strong>. The setInterval method executes a function that you pass in as a parameter at a deteremined interval. The interval is also a parameter, and is passed in as milliseconds. <em>Protip: 1000 milliseconds = 1 second</em>. A generic setInterval method might look something like <code>setInterval(functionYouWantToRun(), 1000)</code>.</p>

<p>This was perfect for my countdown function, which needed to do the same thing &ndash; namely, count down from ten to zero &ndash; every one second.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what my function looked like in the first iteration:
<code>javascript
var counter = 10;
setInterval(function(){
  console.log(counter);
  counter--
  if (counter === 0) {
    console.log("HAPPY NEW YEAR!!");
  }
}, 1000);
</code></p>

<p>I first created a <code>counter</code> variable, which I logged to the console, and then decremented by one each time the function ran. I passed in the two parameters that setInterval requires: a function to execute (in my case, an anonymous, unnamed function), and an interval at which it should be executed (every one second). I also added a conditional to log &ldquo;Happy New Year!&rdquo; once the counter hit zero.</p>

<p>So, did it work? YES! But also, NO. This code <em>does</em> count down from 10, and prints out &ldquo;HAPPY NEW YEAR!!&rdquo; when it hits zero. But now, there was another problem: it just WOULD. NOT. STOP.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tGznKSo.gif" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<h2>Make it stop!! Or, clearInterval()</h2>

<p>The setInterval method is great and all, until you hit an infinite loop and your code runs forever and ever and ever and &ndash; you get the idea. This method on its own doesn&rsquo;t do much more than loop by default. But, when it&rsquo;s combined with its twin method <strong>clearInterval()</strong>, which &ndash; you guessed it &ndash; clears the function at a certain interval, you it can acutally be quite handy.</p>

<p>So, how does clearInterval work? Well, it takes just one parameter: the function that you want to clear. This is important for remember for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>You have to save your setInterval method to a variable</li>
<li>This variable must be accessible (in scope) by the clearInterval method</li>
</ol>


<p>A clearInterval method might look something like <code>clearInterval(func)</code>, where <code>var func = setInterval(functionYouWantToRun(), 1000)</code>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what the second iteration of my function looked like:
<code>javascript
var counter = 10;
var newYearCountdown = setInterval(function(){
  console.log(counter);
  counter--
  if (counter === 0) {
    console.log("HAPPY NEW YEAR!!");
    clearInterval(newYearCountdown);
  }
}, 1000);
</code></p>

<p>I saved my function to variable called <code>newYearCountdown</code>, and then passed that variable in as a parameter to my clearInterval method, which will only fire when the <code>counter</code> variable is set to zero. When <code>var counter</code> is set to zero, a couple things will happen:</p>

<ol>
<li>The string <code>HAPPY NEW YEAR!!</code> will be logged to the console</li>
<li>The clearInterval method will execute</li>
<li>The setInterval method will stop running</li>
</ol>


<p>And this is what will be printed out:
<code>
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
</code></p>

<p>Maybe my next blog post should be figuring out how to change that gif from &ldquo;2012&rdquo; to &ldquo;2015&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>Hope you had a wonderful New Year&rsquo;s! Here&rsquo;s to 2015 and many more Technical Tuesdays! (I hope.)</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>setInterval</strong> method takes a function to execute and a interval in milliseconds.</li>
<li>The <strong>clearInterval</strong> method takes an in-scope variable which points to the setInterval method.</li>
<li>Both of these timing events work together as a pair.</li>
