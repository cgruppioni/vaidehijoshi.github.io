<p>It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. It was&hellip;refactoring time! Well it was for me yesterday, at least.</p>

<p>Refactoring your own code has a great payoff at the end, but boy, does it take some work to get there. Something I&rsquo;ve noticed about my own code recently is that I&rsquo;m now able to know that something needs to be refactored pretty easily. I&rsquo;ve been having a lot of gut feelings about parts of my code that just <em>feel</em> wrong, inefficient, and repetitive. The problem is, even though I know where my code is weak, I don&rsquo;t usually know <em>how</em> to go about making my code better.</p>

<p>And this is where making effective use of resources (read: The Art Of Effective Googling) comes quite in handy. Yesterday, however, I used even better resource &ndash; a more experienced developer! We took a look at my code and came up with some ways I could refactor it. I learned about a pretty interesting module that could save me lines of code and keep my application <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>. And now I get to share it with you! This module is called <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/forwardable/rdoc/Forwardable.html">Forwardable</a>, and trust me when I say that it&rsquo;s going to make you want to delegate all the things.</p>

<h2>Infatuation With Delegation</h2>

<p>Before we even get to Ruby&rsquo;s Forwardable module, let&rsquo;s first make sure we understand delegation. So, <em>whut</em> exactly is delegation? It&rsquo;s probably exactly what you imagine it to be. In plain English, when you delegate something to someone else, you divide up responsibilities amongst yourselves. For example, if I had someone to delegate all these blog posts to, I wouldn&rsquo;t have to write all of them myself! But I digress; back to programming.</p>

<p>Delegation in programming is not too different. When an object has a lot of responsibilities and things to do, it&rsquo;s generally easier to give some of those responsibilities to another object &ndash; a &ldquo;helper&rdquo; object &ndash; to avoid repetition and keep things working efficiently. Let&rsquo;s put this in some technical context for a hot minute: we can use a technique called <strong>encapsulation</strong> to pack a bunch of functionality into a single object&rsquo;s class and instance methods.</p>

<p>Ok, maybe you&rsquo;re not a fan of technical jargon. Maybe you&rsquo;d much rather prefer a real-life example of delegation? Alright, here you are:

<p>Ugh. You&rsquo;ve probably already recoiled in horror. We have a <code>Book</code> object, which has a <code>language</code>, <code>year</code>, <code>author</code>, and <code>title</code>. And we have a <code>Product</code> object, which creates a new instance of a <code>Book</code> object, and then pretty much repeats all those methods again, using the instance it creates in the <code>initialize</code> method.</p>

<p>We already know this code is bad. But how to go about refactoring it? Use Forwardable, obvs, and do some forwarding! We&rsquo;ll delegate all the handling of information to the <code>Book</code> object. Our <code>Product</code> class doesn&rsquo;t need to worry about that!</p>

<p>Cool. So how do we do this? Like so:</p>

<ul>
<li>Let&rsquo;s first get rid of all of those methods in the <code>Product</code> class. We&rsquo;ll keep our <code>initialize</code> method, since that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ll create a new instance of <code>Book</code> in order to have something that we can call methods on. Now our class looks pretty empty:</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="ruby">class Product 
  def initialize
    @book = Book.new
  end
end
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ll add the Forwardable module, part of the Ruby standard library, by extending it in the first line of the class:</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="ruby">extend Forwardable
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Now we&rsquo;ll specify the methods that we to call on a <code>Book</code> object <em>through</em> our <code>Product</code> class by using the <code>def_delegators</code> method, available through Forwardable:</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="ruby">def_delegators :@book, :language, :year, :author
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>We also want to get the title as well, but we want to rename that method as <code>info</code>. We can use <code>def_delegator</code> in order to do that:</li>
</ul>


<pre><code class="ruby">def_delegator :@book, :title, :info
</code></pre>

<p>Now we&rsquo;ve cut down these two classes a lot. Our refactored code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Book
  def language
    "English"
  end

  def year
    "1926"
  end

  def author
    "Ernest Hemingway"
  end

  def title
    "The Sun Also Rises"
  end
end

class Product
  extend Forwardable

  def_delegators :@book, :language, :year, :author
    def_delegator :@book, :title, :info

  def initialize
    @book = Book.new
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>What can this refactored code actually do? Well, it lets us call <code>info</code> on a <code>Product</code> and get back the title of the book! And it allows us to call <code>year</code> directly on an instance of <code>Product</code>:
<code>
p = Product.new
 =&gt; #&lt;Product:0x007feb2183ea78 @book=#&lt;Book:0x007feb2183e9d8&gt;&gt;
p.year
 =&gt; "1926"
p.info
 =&gt; "The Sun Also Rises"
</code></p>

<p>But wait &ndash; we didn&rsquo;t write a <code>year</code> method in the <code>Product</code> class! Well, okay, we <em>kind</em> of did. We used <code>def_delegators</code>, to tell the <code>Product</code> class that it should respond to three methods: <code>language</code>, <code>author</code>, and <code>year</code>. And, we&rsquo;re telling the <code>Product</code> class to respond to each of these methods by calling it on an instance of <code>@book</code>.</p>

<p>And how did we rewrite that <code>title</code> method, exactly? We used <code>def_delegator</code> (singular, not plural!) to tell the <code>Product</code> class to respond to a method called <code>info</code> by calling <code>title</code> on <code>@book</code>. The reason that this works is only because we already have a <code>title</code> method defined on all instances of the <code>Book</code> class.</p>

<h2>Delegate Like You Mean It</h2>

<p>Using the Forwardable module comes in handy not just for refactoring, but also for your initial structuring of an application. Anytime you have an object handling lots of functionality, think about whether you can encapsulate that functionality into another class, and delegate the methods that aren&rsquo;t directly required into that &ldquo;helper&rdquo; class.</p>

<p>There are some great blog posts with examples of how to use the Forwardable module effectively. Here&rsquo;s an implementation on a Reading List class (think Goodreads):
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">def_delegator :@books, :push, :add_book</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">def initialize</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">    @books = []</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">end      </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;/</span><span class="n">code</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="sr">/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;p&gt;end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s some pretty bomb stuff happening in such few lines. The <code>ReadingList</code> class gets initialized with an empty array, which we save as an instance variable, <code>@books</code>. Then we&rsquo;ve also our <code>def_delegators</code>, which delegate <code>map</code>, <code>size</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, and <code>shuffle</code> to the <code>@books</code>. And we have two methods that we (kinda) wrote: <code>remove_book</code> and <code>add_book</code>.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of stuff for 9 lines of code! So what can this do, exactly? Well, let&rsquo;s see our reading list in action:
<code>
vaidehis_list = ReadingList.new
 =&gt; #&lt;ReadingList:0x007feb21a6d0b0 @books=[]&gt;
vaidehis_list.add_book('For Whom The Bell Tolls')
 =&gt; ["For Whom The Bell Tolls"]
vaidehis_list.add_book('The Old Man And The Sea')
 =&gt; ["For Whom The Bell Tolls", "The Old Man And The Sea"]
 vaidehis_list.add_book('To Have And To Have Not')
 =&gt; ["For Whom The Bell Tolls", "The Old Man And The Sea", "To Have And To Have Not"]
vaidehis_list.size
 =&gt; 3
vaidehis_list.shuffle
 =&gt; ["For Whom The Bell Tolls", "To Have And To Have Not", "The Old Man And The Sea"]
vaidehis_list.remove_book
 =&gt; "For Whom The Bell Tolls"
vaidehis_list.size
 =&gt;
</code></p>

<p><em>Dayummmmm</em>. Pretty sweet, right? We get to call all these methods directly on our <code>ReadingList</code> class! But what are they actually getting called on? Well, by using <code>def_delegators</code> and <code>def_delegator</code>, we&rsquo;re telling our <code>ReadingList</code> class to call methods like <code>shift</code> and <code>shuffle</code> on our <code>@books</code> instance. And here&rsquo;s where it gets pretty cool: our <code>@books</code> variable is&hellip;an ARRAY.</p>

<p>Just in case you&rsquo;re not as enthused about this fact as I am, let me explain what this means. It means that we can have access to every single method available on an array instance. Just in case you&rsquo;re wondering, all instance of <code>Array</code>s have 113 methods available to them (not including the 54 methods available to all instance of <code>Object</code>)! All we&rsquo;d have to do is add a method (literally, you can choose any method available on an array) like <code>flat_map</code> to our <code>def_delegators</code> line, and tada! It&rsquo;s ours to use on our <code>ReadingList</code> object.</p>

<p>You can see how this can get pretty powerful, pretty fast. In just a few lines of code, we&rsquo;re exercising the functionality of an entire plain old ruby object (PORO), simply by delegating methods through Forwardable.</p>

<p>Okay, that was a lot of refactoring magic. I told you, right? Lots of effort, but lots of payoff! Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I apparently have some books to read.</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Delegation is the idea that an object can delegate a task to an associated &ldquo;helper&rdquo; object.</li>
<li>The Forwardable module uses <code>def_delegators</code> to delegate methods to another Ruby object, and <code>def_delegator</code> to rename a method that&rsquo;s being delegated to another object.</li>
<li>For another example of this module, read this <a href="http://oneofthesedaysblog.com/ruby-day-4-forwardable">incredibly thorough</a> blog post on implementing Forwardable.</li>

<p><br></p>

<p><em>This blog post is part of a series on State Machines. Read Part 1 <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/03/17/a-machine-state-of-mind-part-1-understanding-state-machines/">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>Until you encounter a state machine in a gem, framework, or within someone else&rsquo;s code, you probably won&rsquo;t find one very easily. But as we learned last week, they&rsquo;re rather pervasive. I discovered state machines while helping build a large-scale eCommerce website.</p>

<p>But there actually weren&rsquo;t even that many state machines in our code! We were relying on state machines that lived in the source code of a Rails library with a variety of gems, commonly referred to as <a href="https://github.com/spree">spree</a>. (Why reinvent ecommerce platforms when so many people have already made &lsquo;em, amirite?)</p>

<p>So, I did what any self-respecting, completely unaware new developer would do: I dove into the spree source code. And boy, was <em>that</em> a rabbit hole. But, I learned some things about how state machines work in Rails and how to make them. It&rsquo;s good to conceptually understand the theory behind state machines, but the best way to learn something is by doing it. It&rsquo;s time to take off the training wheels and actually <em>build</em> our own state machine!</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Starting Up The Machine Engine</h2>

<p>There are a few different options for implementing state machines in a Rails application; spree, for example, uses the <a href="https://github.com/pluginaweek/state_machine/tree/master">state_machine plugin</a>. Personally, I prefer the <a href="https://github.com/aasm/aasm">acts_as_state_machine gem</a> (aasm), as I&rsquo;ve found it to be a bit easier to use and understand.</p>

<p>Once we <code>gem install aasm</code> and add it to our application&rsquo;s <code>Gemfile</code>, we&rsquo;ll want to include it in the body of the class we&rsquo;re trying to implement the state machine on. In the case of our bookstore application, our <code>Order</code> objects are what will be transitioning from one state to another. As the application begins to grow, it&rsquo;ll be useful to namespace our objects (<code>Book::Order</code>) before including the module:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Book::Order
  include AASM
end
</code></pre>

<p>Including the gem is the easy part. The next part is slightly trickier, yet remains pretty intuitive. First, we&rsquo;ll start by defining two states: an initial <code>state</code> that we want our object to start off in, and a second <code>state</code> we want our object to transition to. Then, we&rsquo;ll want to adding an <code>event</code> with an <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> in its <code>transition</code>:
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">aasm</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">state</span> <span class="ss">:unplaced</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:initial</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">state</span> <span class="ss">:submitted</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;p&gt;  event :submit do</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">    transitions :from =&gt; :unplaced, :to =&gt; :submitted</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">  end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>Notice that the <code>event :submit</code> is the present tense verb form of the <code>state :submitted</code>. And when the <code>submit</code> event is called, the <code>Book::Order</code> object&rsquo;s <code>state</code> will transition from one state to the other.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much all you really need to implement a state machine. But of course, we&rsquo;ve only got two states here, which isn&rsquo;t really much of a machine and definitely doesn&rsquo;t take advantage of all the functionalities that <code>aasm</code> provides us with.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s continue to build on the state machine based on <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Nd3ityK.png">the diagram</a> from last week&rsquo;s post and add a few more states and events:

<p>Whoa &ndash; now we&rsquo;re talking! This state machine is even more complex than the diagram we started off with!</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that we even have a <code>state :returned</code> and an <code>event :return</code>, which transition from a <code>complete</code> state to a <code>returned</code> one. And if you&rsquo;ve got a really good eye, you&rsquo;ll see that the <code>process</code> event has changed, too. Now, we can call the <code>process</code> event on the object when it&rsquo;s either in the <code>submitted</code> state or the <code>returned</code> state.</p>

<p>Our state machine is now a <em>self-referential</em> structure, which means that the <code>process</code> event looks back to states within the machine to determine whether it can continue forward or not. This all seems pretty cool, but you better buckle in &ndash; it&rsquo;s about to get <em>even cooler</em>.</p>

<h2>Test Driving Your Machine</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s lovely that we have this machine and all, but what&rsquo;s the fun if you can&rsquo;t take it out for a whirl? So, let&rsquo;s see what this thing can do.</p>

<p>This gem in particular provides us with a variety of public methods for any instances of our <code>Book::Order</code> class, all via our state machine:</p>

<pre><code>order = Book::Order.new # =&gt; =&gt; #&lt;Book::Order:0x007fad3d51aa30&gt;
order.unplaced?         # =&gt; true
order.may_submit?       # =&gt; true
order.submit            # calls the `submit` event

order.submitted?        # =&gt; true
order.unplaced?         # =&gt; false
order.may_submit?       # =&gt; false
order.submit            # =&gt; raises AASM::InvalidTransition
</code></pre>

<p><em>Protip</em>: If you&rsquo;re not a big fan of raising exceptions in your application, just add <code>aasm :whiny_transitions =&gt; false do</code> right inside of your class, and you&rsquo;ll return basic <code>boolean</code> values instead of exceptions.</p>

<p>Whew! So that&rsquo;s a lot of methods. But we didn&rsquo;t have to write <em>any</em> of them! Isn&rsquo;t that fantastic? Hopefully the usefulness of state machines is starting to come together now. Remember before we knew what a state machine was? How would we have had to handle all of this functionality?</p>

<p>We would&rsquo;ve had to do all of the following, multiple times:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make a migration that adds a <code>state</code> or <code>status</code> column in our <code>Book::Object</code> class, with a <code>string</code> value.</li>
<li>Give the <code>state</code> column an initial default value of <code>unplaced</code>.</li>
<li>Add an instance method called <code>unplaced?</code> with a <code>boolean</code> return value.</li>
<li>Add another instance method called <code>submit</code>, which changes the object&rsquo;s <code>state</code> property from <code>"unplaced"</code> to <code>"submitted"</code>.</li>
<li>Add yet <em>another</em> instance method called <code>submitted?</code>, with (at the very least), a single-line <code>if</code> conditional.</li>
<li>Add some more instance methods for good measure, all with some logic in them to keep track of our object&rsquo;s <code>state</code>.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 3-6 for every single new <code>state</code> we wanted to add.</li>
</ol>

<p><br></p>

<p>If we compare this horrifying list to our state machine, it&rsquo;s pretty clear that our machine takes care of all of this! Yes, it requires a little bit of setup when we create our class, but come on, it&rsquo;s like, four lines of code for each state! So much better. And you get all these methods for free! And they&rsquo;re pretty powerful, because we can call them anywhere in our code, on any instance of our object.</p>

<p>But can we customize this machine even further? Heck yes, we can!</p>

<h2>Trick Out Yo&#8217; Ride</h2>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve created a basic state machine, we can trick it out with any (or all!) of these options:</p>

<h3>1. Pass a block to an <code>event</code></h3>

<p>Whenever you want a specific event to call a particular method, simply pass a block to the method. The block will only be called if the transition occurs successfully.

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>These callbacks work exactly as you might think, hooking into either a state or an event. Before the <code>Order</code> switches states from <code>processed</code> to <code>shipped</code>, the <code>print_return_label</code> method will fire. But the <code>send_delete_confirmation</code> method will only be called after the <code>delete event</code> is finished &ndash; only after the transition from <code>processing</code> to <code>deleted</code> occurs successfully.</p>

<h3>3. Implement a guard</h3>

<p>If you want to only allow a transition if a particular condition is defined; if the guard returns <code>false</code>, the transition will be denied, and will either return <code>false</code> or raise an error.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">event :submit do
  transitions :from =&gt; :unplaced, :to =&gt; :submitted, :guard =&gt; :payment_successfully_processed?
end

def payment_successfully_processed?
  # Returns a truthy value based on
  # whether the user's credit card info
  # has been processed successfully or not
end
</code></pre>

<p>These are just three things you can do to spice up your state machine. Creating a state machine with this gem gives you a fair amount of flexibility. You can use multiple guards or build multiple transitions for a single event. As your state machine grows, you can call the <code>aasm.current_event</code> to keep track of where you are in your code.</p>

<p>Now that you know how to implement a state machine, hopefully you now realize the value in them and don&rsquo;t feel too intimidated. As long as you take it a step at a time, you can create your own state machine, with the exact kind of functionality your program needs. With that said, there&rsquo;s only one thing left to do: go forth implement one yourself! Fly young grasshopper, fly!</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>State machines can be broken down into <code>states</code> and <code>events</code>. Events control the flow of one <code>state</code> to another.</li>
<li>Each <code>event</code> has a <code>from</code> and a <code>to transition</code>. Only if a transition occurs successfully will an object&rsquo;s <code>state</code> change. You can manipulate how an event or transition works using callbacks, blocks, and guards.</li>

<p>My favorite thing about programming is the fact that you never run out of opportunities to be completely floored. There&rsquo;s literally <em>always</em> either a concept, theory, framework, or language that you don&rsquo;t know. This is actually fantastic, because there&rsquo;s no dearth of opportunity when it comes to learning. And you always come head-to-head with these facts when you pair program with a more experienced developer.</p>

<p>One of the new concepts that I encountered this week was the idea of <strong>state machines</strong>, sometimes referred to as &ldquo;finite state machines&rdquo;. At first I thought that this was something unique to the gem that we are using in one of our large-scale applications, but it turns out it&rsquo;s not a Rails thing. In fact, it&rsquo;s not even a Ruby thing! It&rsquo;s a <em>Computer Science</em> thing; to be a bit more specific, it&rsquo;s a mathematical abstraction used to design complex algorithms. But for all intents and purposes, it&rsquo;s a Computer Science theory that we use almost all the time, whether we know it or not.</p>

<p>If you got through that paragraph without freaking out, you deserve a medal. All this CS theory sounds terrifying, right? Well, don&rsquo;t worry. For programming purposes, you don&rsquo;t actually need to think too much about how state machines are constructed and what&rsquo;s being abstracted away. Even though state machines can get incredibly complex, relatively quickly, let&rsquo;s not overwhelm ourselves; we only need to think about state machines in the context of programming. So we&rsquo;ll keep it simple and focus on what state machines are, how they work, and when to use them.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>State Machines: What Are They?</h2>

<p>A state machine is nothing more than a flow chart. And here&rsquo;s the thing about flowcharts: <em>they&rsquo;re everywhere</em>. If you think about it, a flowchart is just a way of controlling the flow of a set of actions. You have different conditions, and depending on your condition &ndash; or &ldquo;state&rdquo;, as we refer to it in programmatic terms &ndash; you&rsquo;ll take a certain action.</p>

<p>For example, if you&rsquo;re hungry, you&rsquo;ll eat some food, probably a slice of cheesecake. If you&rsquo;re still hungry, you&rsquo;ll eat another slice. When you&rsquo;re full, you&rsquo;ll stop eating cheesecake (LOL, like anyone could ever be &ldquo;too full&rdquo; from cheesecake). You have different states of being, and certain events trigger you to move from one state to another &ndash; from hungry, to less hungry, to completely full.</p>

<p>One of the simplest definitions that I found for state machines in the context of programming comes from a <a href="http://lamsonproject.org/docs/introduction_to_finite_state_machines.html">Lamson Project blog post</a> :</p>

<blockquote><p>A practical finite state machine is basically four things: 1) A bunch of functions, or things that need to get done. 2) A bunch of events, or reasons to call these functions. 3) Some piece of data that tracks the &ldquo;state&rdquo; this bunch of functions is in. 4) Code inside the functions that says how to &ldquo;transition&rdquo; or &ldquo;change&rdquo; into the next state for further processing.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the risk of sounding a bit philosophical, it all boils down to actions that are taken, and the reasons we take certain actions. State machines are how we keep track of different events, and control the flow between those events.</p>

<h2>A State Of Being: How to Use State Machines</h2>

<p>The best way of understanding <em>how</em> to use a state machine in your own application is by seeing an example of it in another application. A good place to start is usually a commonly-used, large-scale web application. Since we&rsquo;ve been using my bookstore application in <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/03/10/its-all-in-the-family-using-acts-as-tree/">prior blog posts</a>, we&rsquo;ll use another eCommerce example to understand state machines. Here&rsquo;s a very simplified example of a basic order processing state machine:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Nd3ityK.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<p>If we follow the event flow, we start to get an idea of the different actions that trigger different states. Each <code>Order</code> starts off with an initial state (something that we&rsquo;ll explore a bit more when we build our own state machine), and requires a certain event to occur for its state to change. This means that only if an <code>Order</code> is <em>placed</em>, will the <code>Order</code>&rsquo;s state be changed to <code>submitted</code>.</p>

<p>The event triggers are important because without them, there wouldn&rsquo;t be enough clarity to move from one state to another. Take a look at the <code>Order</code> when it&rsquo;s in the <code>processing</code> state. The <code>Order</code> must be either <code>fulfilled</code> or <code>canceled</code> in order for it to proceed to the next state.</p>

<p>This particular state machine is <em>very</em> simple, and doesn&rsquo;t even account for the return or refund process! Imagine what that might look like! You could have states that could have events that <em>refer back</em> to themselves, which would make them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graphs</a>. Things would start to get really complicated, really fast.</p>

<p>But, if we think back to the Lamson Project&rsquo;s definition of a state machine, our order processing example still fits the bill:</p>

<ol>
<li>Our <strong>functions</strong>, the stuff that needs to get done, are the different things that need to happen for an event to trigger. For example, the <code>User</code> has to input a valid credit card number, cvv, expiration date, and shipping address just so that the <code>Order</code> can transition from <code>unplaced</code> to <code>submitted</code>.</li>
<li>Our <strong>events</strong>, the reasons to call the functions, are the actual actions taken during the flow of the machine. The <code>User</code> actually has to successfully <em>submit</em> the form and the data has to be passed from the <code>User</code> and stored in the database so that the event can successfully occur.</li>
<li>Our <strong>states</strong>, the data that tracks these functions, are the different conditions that our order can be in. If the <code>Order</code> is <code>processing</code>, all the functionality of fulfilling, packaging, and shipping the order must all be contained within that state.</li>
<li>Our <strong>code inside the functions</strong> would be all the intricate methods that do all the work prior to each event occurring and each state changing. For example, you&rsquo;d probably have a validation to check whether the user had input a valid zip code (something like <code>validates :zip_code_length</code>) before transitioning from an <code>unplaced</code> <code>Order</code> to a <code>submitted</code> one. And you&rsquo;d probably want to execute an <code>in_stock?</code> method before switching from the <code>processing</code> state to the <code>shipped</code> state.</li>
</ol>


<h2>The Case For State Machines</h2>

<p>While understanding state machines is great, is it always the right tool for the job? From my research and reading, it seems like most of the time, it is. <a href="http://www.skorks.com/2011/09/why-developers-never-use-state-machines/">This post</a> by Alan Skorkin gives some pretty good insight into <em>why</em> developers never use state machines. Many developers seem to be intimidated by the very concept of state machines, or sometimes don&rsquo;t even understand them in the first place, which can be cause to avoid them at all costs. Other programmers see them as complex and overly complicated, and perhaps not necessary when you&rsquo;re first starting off in building your application. And sometimes it&rsquo;s just hard to foresee how your application is going to grow, and determine whether or not a state machine is the right tool for the job.</p>

<p>Even though setting up a state machine takes a bit of initial effort, it can save you a lot of pain in the long run. Even though many programmers can&rsquo;t predict when they&rsquo;ll need a state machine, almost every application has some form of flow that fits the bill. And let&rsquo;s face it: almost every web application these days actually strives to <em>do</em> something, which means that it will inevitably have some sort of flow of events.</p>

<p>This fantastic <a href="http://www.shopify.com/technology/3383012-why-developers-should-be-force-fed-state-machines">Shopify blog post</a> makes a great case for why ever programmer needs to be &ldquo;force-fed&rdquo; the state machine concept. The most important part of all of this debate, however, is understanding the state machine pattern. You have to understand the pattern first, and then you can figure out whether you need to spend the time in actually implementing it.</p>

<p>Thankfully, there are a few common red flags that indicate if this is the case:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A <code>state</code> or a <code>status</code> attribute on any of your objects: <code>Book::Order.first.status</code></p></li>
<li><p>Instance methods that return a <code>boolean</code> value: <code>Book::Order.first.shipped?</code></p></li>
<li><p>Records that are only valid for a certain period of time: <code>User::Membership.first.subscriptions #=&gt; "expired"</code></p></li>
</ol>


<p>If your code base has any of these, you can probably benefit from a state machine. I went back and looked at my old web apps, and found that each and every one of them had at least one, if not more, of these situations. In fact, almost every Rails application is bound to have some variation of these three different scenarios, which means that we should all learn how to use state machines and become better developers!</p>

<p>So how do you actually go about creating a state machine? Well, that&rsquo;s a whole other <del>game</del> blog post entirely. Tune in again next Tuesday, when I&rsquo;ll explore how to actually go about <em>implementing</em> a state machine in your Rails application! Get excited! Like this:</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>State machines control the flow of events in a web application by using certain events to trigger different states or conditions.</li>
<li>If you find that your app has methods like <code>state</code> or <code>status</code> and <code>shipped?</code> or <code>received?</code>, you should try using a state machine.</li>

<p><br></p>

<p>When working in Rails, it&rsquo;s all the family &ndash; literally. No matter the size of your application, almost all of your objects are going to be related to each other. You can create however many objects you wan because database rows are cheap, cheap, cheap! But the more objects you make, the harder it is to keep track of the other data that the object relates to (which is generally yet <em>another</em> object).</p>

<p>I found myself in such a predicament last week, when I had to make numerous objects relate to one other to create a tree structure. The obvious first approach was to use the <code>belongs_to</code> and <code>has_many</code> relationship. But when I realized that I wanted some <code>Genre</code> objects to belong to <em>other</em> <code>Genre</code> objects, I ran into a problem. Depending solely on the ActiveRecord relationships turned out to be painful, messy, and complicated, and wouldn&rsquo;t make my code very flexible or sustainable over time.</p>

<p>So I Googled around and found a handy plugin created by DHH himself called <code>acts_as_tree</code>. This gem allows you to create a hierarchical structure of objects in your application and &ndash; to take it a step further &ndash; gives you a bunch of incredibly helpful methods. It even allows you to visualize your tree structure! Sound amazing? That&rsquo;s because it is. And if you follow a few easy steps, you can use it in your application, too.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Family Ties</h2>

<p>So, for this post I&rsquo;ll continue working through my basic eCommerce Bookstore application, which I&rsquo;ve been using as an example for my previous posts. I&rsquo;ve already got some <code>Book</code> objects, but as my store starts to grow, it&rsquo;s going to be pretty hard to keep track of the different genres of <code>Book</code> objects that I currently have available.</p>

<p>The first step to tackling this problem was easy: create <code>Genre</code> objects, each of which <code>has_many</code> different <code>Book</code> objects associated with it, while each <code>Book</code> object will <code>belong_to</code> one specific <code>Genre</code>.</p>

<p>But what about genres that are associated with and &ldquo;descend from&rdquo; other genres? Well, here&rsquo;s where the delightful and easy-to-use <code>acts_as_tree</code> gem comes in.</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/pcPeWllpmv6Zq" width="480" height="431" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p><br></p>

<p>First things first: we&rsquo;ll add <code>gem 'acts_as_tree'</code> to our Gemfile.</p>

<p>Next, we need to add a column to our <code>Genre</code> database. We can write a simple migration that will add a <code>parent_id</code> integer to our database, which will allow us to find the parents and children of a <code>Genre</code> object:
<code>ruby
class AddParentIdColumnToGenre &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :genres, :parent_id, :integer
  end
end
</code></p>

<p>Finally, we&rsquo;ll head over to our <code>Genre</code> model, which is what we needs to act as a (family) tree. We need to add a single line in here, which implements the ActiveRecord plugin and specifies what we&rsquo;ll be ordering our <code>Genre</code> objects by:
<code>ruby
class Genre &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :books
  validates_presence_of :name
  acts_as_tree order: "name"
end
</code></p>

<h2>Blood Is Thicker Than Water</h2>

<p>Okay, now let&rsquo;s see this baby in action! We can start by making a root <code>Genre</code> object, and then giving it some children:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">literature = Genre.create("name" =&gt; "Literature")

non_fiction = literature.children.create("name" =&gt; "Non-Fiction")
fiction = literature.children.create("name" =&gt; "Fiction")
</code></pre>

<p>Cool, but our tree doesn&rsquo;t really look like a tree yet. Let&rsquo;s give our <code>non_fiction</code> and <code>fiction</code> genres some children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of their own:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">biography = non_fiction.children.create("name" =&gt; "Biography")
comic_novel = fiction.children.create("name" =&gt; "Comic Novel")
black_comedy = comic_novel.create("name" =&gt; "Black Comedy")
parody = comic_novel.create("name" =&gt; "Parody")
romantic_comedy = comic_novel.create("name" =&gt; "Romanic Comedy")
satire = comic_novel.create("name" =&gt; "Satire")
poltical_satire = satire.create("name" =&gt; "Political Satire")
</code></pre>

<p>Damn. Okay, well now our tree should look look less like a sprout and more like this bad boy:</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/hMWmNKdcdhAyI" width="480" height="267" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<h2>It Runs In The Family</h2>

<p>Even though we&rsquo;ve created all these parent-child relationships, what can we do with them, exactly? Well, a lot! You can call the <code>parent</code> and <code>children</code> methods to get a full list of all the objects associated with a particular <code>Genre</code> instance:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">literature.parent                   # =&gt; nil
fiction.parent                      # =&gt; literature
literature.children                 # =&gt; [non_fiction, fiction]
literature.children.first.children  # =&gt; [Biography]

literature.root?                    # =&gt; true
fiction.root?                       # =&gt; false
biography.leaf?                     # =&gt; true

black_comedy.siblings               # =&gt; [parody, romantic_comedy, satire]
poltical_satire.ancestors           # =&gt; [satire, comic_novel, fiction, literature]

Genre.root                          # =&gt; literature
</code></pre>

<p>An important thing to note here is that the <code>children</code> method will return an <em>array</em> of objects, even if there&rsquo;s only one child! So if you&rsquo;re trying to get one particular object, remember to call the <code>first</code> method in the array, or search by a <code>Genre</code> object&rsquo;s specific <code>id</code> to avoid annoying bugs.</p>

<p>Some other cool methods to try include:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>leaves</code>, a class method that will return all the &ldquo;leaves&rdquo; of the tree (in an array).</p></li>
<li><p><code>descendants</code>, an instance method that will return all the children, and the children&rsquo;s children of an object (in an array).</p></li>
<li><p><code>self_and_siblings</code>, which returns the receiver object, as well as any siblings it may have (in an array).</p></li>
<li><p><code>default_tree_order</code>, which returns all the objects listed in alphabetical order!</p></li>
</ol>


<p>But the coolest feature of the <code>acts_as_tree</code> gem is Tree View, which allows you to see a visualization of your entire tree. All we have to do view this magic is add this line to our <code>Genre</code> model:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">extend ActsAsTree::TreeView
</code></pre>

<p>And then, call the class method <code>tree_view</code>, which takes in an attribute parameter:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">Genre.tree_view(:name)
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting return value is pure flora magic:
<code>
Literature
 |_ Non-Fiction
 |    |_ Biography
 |_ Fiction
 |    |_ Comic Novel
 |        |_ Black Comedy
 |        |_ Parody
 |        |_ Romantic Comedy
 |        |_ Satire
 |            |_ Political Satire
</code></p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it so beautiful?! Doesn&rsquo;t it make you feel like this:</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/FlWgXEtj5aM5G" width="480" height="259" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p><br></p>

<p>Or maybe it&rsquo;s just me.</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>A lot of people seem to like the <a href="https://github.com/stefankroes/ancestry"><code>ancestry</code> gem</a>, but I think that <code>acts_as_tree</code> is a good one to start off with. If you need the extra functionality that <code>ancestry</code> provides, then you can eventually level up to that. Another variation on the <code>acts_as_tree</code>  is the <a href="https://github.com/chrisroberts/acts_as_sane_tree"><code>acts_as_sane_tree</code> gem</a>, which is configured for PostgreSQL 8.4 and comes with some cool extra methods (but isn&rsquo;t nearly as massive as ancestry).</li>
<li>There are a lot of different ways to implement the <code>acts_as_tree</code>. Check out <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/162-tree-based-navigation">this railscast</a> on tree-based navigation using this gem/plugin (beware the date on this one, though!).</li>

<p>Snowmageddon. Snowpocalypse. The Deep Freeze of 2015. You can call it whatever you want, but we can all agree on one thing: it&rsquo;s so damn cold outside. In fact, it&rsquo;s so cold that I recently saw this error message while debugging a Postgres issue:
<code>RuntimeError: can't modify frozen Hash</code></p>

<p>My first thought was, naturally, <em>holy shit, even my hashes are frozen</em>. I did a little digging, and it turns out that we aren&rsquo;t the only ones susceptible to these chilly temperatures. Apparently, objects can also freeze!</p>

<p>So, in honor of the frozen tundra that we all seem to currently inhabit, I decided to explore the icy-cold depths of Rails frozen objects. Before you read on though, you should know: I&rsquo;m going to use only gifs from the Disney animated film, <em>Frozen</em> — don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn you.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Objects As Cold As Ice</h2>

<p>First things first: what&rsquo;s a frozen object? Well, they&rsquo;re frozen, which means they can&rsquo;t change &ndash; they&rsquo;re immutable and cannot be modified. There are some objects in Ruby that are perpetually frozen, such as any <code>Fixnum</code>, <code>Bignum</code>, <code>Float</code>, and <code>Symbol</code> objects.</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/Fjy5XItIvYjEQ" width="480" height="269" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p><br></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve probably worked with all of these objects before, but may not know that they&rsquo;re actually frozen! Don&rsquo;t believe me? Well, you can check for yourself. Just call the <code>frozen?</code> method on any object of this class:</p>

<pre><code>$ irb
2.2.0 :001 &gt; 1.frozen?
 =&gt; true
2.2.0 :002 &gt; a = :im_a_symbol
 =&gt; :im_a_symbol
2.2.0 :003 &gt; a.frozen?
 =&gt; true
2.2.0 :004 &gt; 3.14.frozen?
 =&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>This kind of makes sense though, right? Imagine if I could just start rewriting values all over the damn place. I could set <code>1</code> equal to <code>nil</code> and make <code>2</code> equal <code>3</code>, and then we&rsquo;d really hit crazytown.</p>

<p>Frozen objects keep certain things secure and certain in Ruby (and also in Rails!) So, freezing objects is a&hellip;good thing? Well, yes. But also, no.</p>

<h2>The Freeze Method: A Cold Piece Of Work</h2>

<p>Just as there&rsquo;s a method to check whether an object is <code>frozen?</code> or not, there&rsquo;s also a method to freeze mutable objects and make them immutable called &ndash; you guessed it &ndash; <code>freeze</code>. This method is pretty simple: yuo just call it on an object in order to rpevent further modifications to said object. If you <em>do</em> try to modify the object after freezing it, you&rsquo;ll get a <code>RuntimeError</code>:
<code>
2.2.0 :005 &gt; x = {1 =&gt; 'a', 2 =&gt; 'b', 3 =&gt; 'c'}
 =&gt; {1=&gt;"a", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}
2.2.0 :006 &gt; x.freeze
 =&gt; {1=&gt;"a", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}
2.2.0 :007 &gt; x.frozen?
 =&gt; true
2.2.0 :008 &gt; x[1] = 'b'
RuntimeError: can't modify frozen Hash
</code></p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/oYKesMM459o4w" width="480" height="200" frameBorder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>But before you get all Elsa on me and start freezing everything, you should know some things about how to use the <code>freeze</code> method as a responsible developer:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First and foremost: don&rsquo;t try to call a <code>defrost</code> or <code>thaw</code> method, because there&rsquo;s no such thing. In fact, there is <em>absolutely no way</em> to unfreeze an object. It simply cannot be undone. So, proceed with great caution when freezing things. Or maybe just don&rsquo;t do it at all.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>freeze</code> method operates on an object reference, not on a variable. Wait, whut? If this sounds like Ruby objects aren&rsquo;t actually being modified, but their references are instead, well&hellip;that&rsquo;s totally right.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I really liked the way that Michael Morin explained this in <a href="http://ruby.about.com/od/qa/ss/Can-T-Modify-Frozen-String.htm">his post</a> on frozen objects:</p>

<blockquote><p>When you freeze a hash, it just freezes the references to the objects it already has, it doesn&rsquo;t actually freeze the objects themselves. The frozen hash won&rsquo;t know the difference here. This is an important thing to understand about freezing objects, it&rsquo;s not recursive. All freezing does is prevent the references the object holds from being modified.</p></blockquote>

<p>While we can&rsquo;t unfreeze &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; objects, this particular quality gives us a little bit leeway to get around the lack of a thaw method.</p>

<h2>Chill Out, But Don&rsquo;t Freeze</h2>

<p>There are a few different ways to change an immutable frozen object (which, hello, aren&rsquo;t actually frozen, just their references are). One thing you can do is create a duplicated object, which will <em>not</em> be frozen and therefore, completely mutable:
<code>
2.2.0 :009 &gt; x.dup
 =&gt; {1=&gt;"a", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}
2.2.0 :010 &gt; y = _
 =&gt; {1=&gt;"a", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}
2.2.0 :011 &gt; y.frozen?
 =&gt; false
2.2.0 :012 &gt; x.frozen?
 =&gt; true
2.2.0 :013 &gt; y[1] = 'b'
 =&gt; "b"
2.2.0 :014 &gt; y
 =&gt; {1=&gt;"b", 2=&gt;"b", 3=&gt;"c"}
</code></p>

<p>Keep in mind, however, that this only changes the data in the duplicated object, not the original one! So&hellip;what now? Well, since only the reference to an object is frozen, that means that you can modify the actual data inside of the frozen object:
<code>

<p>Weird, right!? Our <code>x</code> variable, which points to the <code>Hash</code> object, is still very much frozen. But, we can modify the data and values inside of the object itself. Since we don&rsquo;t want to make an actual copy of the variable, we can instead modify the objects held within that variable (in our case, we&rsquo;re directly modifying the <code>String</code> object, which is a the value of a key in this frozen Hash)</p>

<h2>Freezing Out Those Error Messages</h2>

<p>Cool, so this I guess this is a thing in Ruby. But wait &ndash; it&rsquo;s also a pretty important thing in Rails! Objects in Rails are infinitely more complicated than in Ruby, mostly because you&rsquo;re dealing with ActiveRecord and its methods. Whenever you&rsquo;re trying to delete an ActiveRecord object, you depend on the <code>destroy</code> method.</p>

<p>For example, I use this method in my bookstore app, and I have a <code>delete</code> action in my <code>BooksController</code> that contains code that looks something like this:
<code>ruby
@book = Book.find(1)
@book.destroy
</code></p>

<p>Now if I wanted to modfiy this book&rsquo;s type after I delete it, I&rsquo;d get an error:
<code>
[1] pry(main)&gt; @book.type = 'hardcover'
TypeError: can't modify frozen hash
</code></p>

<p>Why is this? Well, even though I deleted the object, it still exists in the <code>@book</code> variable, which still retains all the attributes of the object. Once I destroy the record, the object became frozen. Since the object&rsquo;s attributes hash is frozen, when I try to modify it, I get this error.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Persistence.html#method-i-destroy">Rails documentation</a> explains how it implements the <code>freeze</code> method, stating that <code>destroy</code> method:</p>

<blockquote><p>Deletes the record in the database and freezes this instance to reflect that no changes should be made (since they can&rsquo;t be persisted).</p></blockquote>

<p>To avoid creating a <code>@book</code> object that&rsquo;s frozen and still hanging around for no apparent reason, I could instead implicitly delete the object in a single line. Either this:
<code>ruby
Book.find(1)destroy
</code>
or
<code>ruby
Book.destroy(1)
</code>
would work.</p>

<p>Alternatively, I could just use the <code>delete</code> method, which doesn&rsquo;t instantiate an object, but isntead directly removes the row from the database.</p>

<p>Frozen objects are in front of us everyday. Ruby actually uses the <code>freeze</code> method when you copy certain objects. According to <a href="http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/mutable_and_immutable_objects.html">this post</a>, when you use a string as a key of a <code>Hash</code> object, the string is copied, frozen, and then that duplicated copy is used as the key of the hash. This is pretty cool because this means that even if the original string is modified, the duplicated one isn&rsquo;t affected because it has been frozen! The same goes for filenames: internal operations of an application rely on a frozen copy of a filename, rather than the original one.</p>

<p>Once you understand the functionality of <code>freeze</code>, it becomes a lot easier to understand those weird error messages. Soon, you&rsquo;ll no longer fear the ice, but instead bask in the sun. Or&hellip;something more poetic.</p>

<p>Anyways, here&rsquo;s a dancing snowman:</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>You can use the <code>freeze</code> method to make mutable objects immutable. To check whether an object can be modified or not, use the <code>frozen?</code> method, which will return a boolean value.</li>
<li>Certain Ruby objects, such as integers, floats, and symbols, are always frozen and cannot be modified.</li>
<li>Someone made a <a href="https://github.com/zizkovrb/melt">melt gem</a> &ndash; for realsies!</li>
<li>Some people are <a href="http://m.onkey.org/ruby-i-don-t-like-3-object-freeze">not big fans</a> of the weird functionality of Ruby <code>freeze</code>. But it&rsquo;s still worth it to <a href="http://blog.adamstegman.com/activerecord-hangs-on-to-destroyed-relations.html">learn how it works</a>, especially since it can be <a href="http://blog.adamstegman.com/activerecord-hangs-on-to-destroyed-relations.html">super helpful</a> for <a href="http://www.devarticles.com/c/a/Ruby-on-Rails/Updating-and-Deleting-with-the-Active-Record/2/">debugging Rails apps</a>.</li>
