<p>There comes a time in the life of every developer when you stop thinking about whether your code works. Instead, you concern yourself with something else entirely: how <em>efficiently</em> your code works.</p>

<p>In fact, you can trace this back to Kent Beck&rsquo;s <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast">philosophy</a> of &ldquo;Make it work, make it right, make it fast.&rdquo; Once you&rsquo;ve got your code doing what you want it to do, you need to make it better. But what do you do with your improved code once you&rsquo;ve set it right? Make sure that it&rsquo;s working as fast as it possibly can, of course!</p>

<p>Code efficiency is a bit of an advanced topic, and I&rsquo;m definitely no expert in it. But I recently learned a pretty awesome querying method that&rsquo;s neither difficult to understand nor too complex to implement. In fact, this method has always been right under your nose, hidden inside of the magic that is ActiveRecord. So what is this magical method, exactly? Well, it&rsquo;s called <strong>includes</strong>, and once you start using it, you&rsquo;ll never make database queries the same way again.</p>

<h2>Inquiries on Querying</h2>

<p>The best way to know how to make your code run at warp drive is by first figuring out how fast it is to start with. But before we get into the issue of speed, let&rsquo;s check out what our code base looks like:

<p>Nothing <em>too</em> fancy happening here. We&rsquo;ve got a one-to-many relationship here, with a <code>User</code> object having many <code>Orders</code>, and each <code>Order</code> belonging to a <code>User</code>. There&rsquo;s also a class method called <code>all_order_details</code> in our <code>User</code> class. This method queries for all of the <code>User</code> objects in our database, and loops through each <code>User</code> instance, grabbing each order, and calling <code>details</code> on it. And if we take a look at our <code>Order</code> class, we&rsquo;ll see that <code>details</code> is just an attribute on <code>Order</code>. (Forget what that weird <code>class &lt;&lt; self</code> syntax means? Jog your memory with <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/02/24/class-inheritance-part-2-singletons-and-eigens-oh-my/">this post</a> from a few weeks ago.)</p>

<p>Our plan is to use this method in an admin panel or dashboard, which is probably the only place where someone would want to see all the order details of every single order placed by every single user in our system. But even though we&rsquo;re not going to be using this method within all of our views, it&rsquo;s still important that we take a look at what it&rsquo;s doing in order to understand whether we can refactor it and make it faster.</p>

<p>So, this code does pretty much exactly what we want it to do. But how fast does it do its job? The only way to find out is by checking out what happens in our server logs when we call our method:
<code>
2.2.0 :001 &gt; User.all_order_details
  User Load (1.1ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users"
  Order Load (0.6ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 1]]
  Order Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 2]]
  Order Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 3]]
  Order Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 4]]
  Order Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 5]]
  Order Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 6]]
  Order Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 7]]
  Order Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 8]]
  Order Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 9]]
  Order Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 10]]
 =&gt; # returns an array of order details
</code></p>

<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa &ndash; hold up. We&rsquo;ve got a problem.</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/iJxHzcuNcCJXi" width="480" height="360" frameBorder="0" style="max-width: 100%" class="giphy-embed" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>Sure, we got an array of <code>Order</code> details, which is great. But doesn&rsquo;t it seem kind of weird that we had to make so many queries? Are the red flags going off in your head, too? Time to investigate.</p>

<h2>The N + 1 Problem</h2>

<p>Okay, so maybe you didn&rsquo;t recoil in horror when you saw all those queries. But let me explain why you probably should. In our database, we currently have 10 <code>Users</code>, each of whom has one <code>Order</code>. If we look at the queries we&rsquo;re currently making, you&rsquo;ll notice that we&rsquo;re first loading all of our <code>User</code> objects:
<code>ruby
User Load (1.1ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users"
</code></p>

<p>Loading all of our <code>Users</code> takes 1.1 milliseconds. But what about our <code>Order</code> details? We need to go through our <code>Users</code> table in order to grab each <code>Order</code>&rsquo;s details. That&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s happening in each one of the queries that looks like this:

Actually, our problem is quite common, and it&#39;s even got a name: **the n + 1 problem**.</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">The crux of the n + 1 problem is essentially this: the number of queries you make will directly correspond to the number of objects (n) that you have in your database.

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">Thankfully, this problem is so common that Rails has a fantastic solution, tailor-made to handle it.</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">## Smarter Querying</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">Rails is a pretty smart cookie -- it allows you to load a bunch of stuff at once ahead of time if you know exactly what you want to query. This is referred to as **eager loading**, and a really easy way to eager load your associations is by using the ActiveRecord method `includes`.</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">You can call `includes` on an object an pass it a parameter of the table you want to load as a symbol name. We can implement this directly on our `all_order_details` method:</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;/</span><span class="n">code</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="sr">/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">&lt;p&gt;def all_order_details</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">  User.all.includes(:orders).each |user|</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">    user.orders.each do |order|</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">      order.details</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">    end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">  end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>This may look pretty similar to our original code at first, but when we look at our server logs, we can see a world of difference:
<code>ruby
2.2.0 :002 &gt; User.all_order_details
  User Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users"
  Order Load (0.3ms)  SELECT "orders".* FROM "orders" WHERE "orders"."user_id" IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
 =&gt; # returns an array of order details
</code></p>

<p>Nice. We have something really cool happening here. Instead of making &ldquo;n + 1&rdquo; number of queries, we&rsquo;re only making two queries. We spend 0.2 milliseconds getting our users, and 0.3 milliseconds loading our orders. We&rsquo;re only spending 0.5 milliseconds compared to the 2.6 milliseconds we were spending before.</p>

<p>How does this work, exactly? Eager loading allows you to specify exactly which tables you want to load into memory. Just by loading them, we&rsquo;re reducing the number of queries we&rsquo;re making. It&rsquo;s like telling ActiveRecord, <em>Hey, I already know I want all the Users and I know I want to do something with their associated Orders. So instead of querying the table one instance at a time, why don&rsquo;t you just be super efficient and grab &lsquo;em all for me in one shot?</em> And that&rsquo;s pretty much exactly what Rails will do.</p>

<p>I also like the way that <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/active-record-queries">the Odin Project</a> explains how <code>includes</code> works:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Includes basically takes the name of one or more associations that you&rsquo;d like to load at the same time as your original object and brings them into memory. You can chain it onto other methods like where or order clauses.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Other helpful methods that do similar things to solve the n + 1 problem are <code>joins</code>, used for joining multiple tables together, and <code>pluck</code>, which grabs a specific column and returns it in an array format.</p>

<h2>Big O Puts the O In &ldquo;Uh Oh&rdquo;</h2>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/fcpJebgkQ14UE" width="480" height="192" frameBorder="0" style="max-width: 100%" class="giphy-embed" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>Dealing with issues of efficiency and speed is a pretty advanced topic, mostly because it gets into the deep depths of computer science and the dreaded concept of <strong>Big O Notation</strong>. Big O deals with the space time complexity of different algorithms.</p>

<p>The n + 1 problem is actually nothing more than a Big O problem, because it has to do with how well your algorithm runs. The Big O complexity of an n + 1 problem is <strong>O(n)</strong>, pronounced &ldquo;Oh of n&rdquo;. An O(n) algorithm is one whose performance will grow linearly, and will be directly proportional to the size of input data (the more <code>Users</code> we have, the larger our query of each user&rsquo;s order details).</p>

<p>Big O should always be <a href="http://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/">taken into consideration</a> while building an app. But that being said, it should never be the first thing that you think about &ndash; particularly if you are a reatively junior developer. The space time complexity of your algorithm is something you can think about while refactoring your code, or rethinking how you&rsquo;re approaching or solving a problem.</p>

<p>Being able to evaluate an algorithm&rsquo;s efficiency is definitely something to work towards, but it&rsquo;s also something that takes practice. Implementing ActiveRecord&rsquo;s <code>includes</code> method is a good way to start playing around with speed and efficiency &ndash; plus, you&rsquo;ll make some kickass queries in the process, and that always feels pretty awesome. (I mean, obviously it&rsquo;s not as awesome as going warp speed on the Enterprise, but hey, it&rsquo;s an acceptable alternative.)</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <code>includes</code> method can be chained on to any ActiveRecord model, and takes parameters of an association/table name, passed in as a symbol. Read more about it in the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#eager-loading-associations">Rails docs</a>.</li>

<p><br></p>

<p><em>This blog post is part of a series on State Machines. Read Part 1 <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/03/17/a-machine-state-of-mind-part-1-understanding-state-machines/">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>Until you encounter a state machine in a gem, framework, or within someone else&rsquo;s code, you probably won&rsquo;t find one very easily. But as we learned last week, they&rsquo;re rather pervasive. I discovered state machines while helping build a large-scale eCommerce website.</p>

<p>But there actually weren&rsquo;t even that many state machines in our code! We were relying on state machines that lived in the source code of a Rails library with a variety of gems, commonly referred to as <a href="https://github.com/spree">spree</a>. (Why reinvent ecommerce platforms when so many people have already made &lsquo;em, amirite?)</p>

<p>So, I did what any self-respecting, completely unaware new developer would do: I dove into the spree source code. And boy, was <em>that</em> a rabbit hole. But, I learned some things about how state machines work in Rails and how to make them. It&rsquo;s good to conceptually understand the theory behind state machines, but the best way to learn something is by doing it. It&rsquo;s time to take off the training wheels and actually <em>build</em> our own state machine!</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Starting Up The Machine Engine</h2>

<p>There are a few different options for implementing state machines in a Rails application; spree, for example, uses the <a href="https://github.com/pluginaweek/state_machine/tree/master">state_machine plugin</a>. Personally, I prefer the <a href="https://github.com/aasm/aasm">acts_as_state_machine gem</a> (aasm), as I&rsquo;ve found it to be a bit easier to use and understand.</p>

<p>Once we <code>gem install aasm</code> and add it to our application&rsquo;s <code>Gemfile</code>, we&rsquo;ll want to include it in the body of the class we&rsquo;re trying to implement the state machine on. In the case of our bookstore application, our <code>Order</code> objects are what will be transitioning from one state to another. As the application begins to grow, it&rsquo;ll be useful to namespace our objects (<code>Book::Order</code>) before including the module:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Book::Order
  include AASM
end
</code></pre>

<p>Including the gem is the easy part. The next part is slightly trickier, yet remains pretty intuitive. First, we&rsquo;ll start by defining two states: an initial <code>state</code> that we want our object to start off in, and a second <code>state</code> we want our object to transition to. Then, we&rsquo;ll want to adding an <code>event</code> with an <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> in its <code>transition</code>:

<p>Notice that the <code>event :submit</code> is the present tense verb form of the <code>state :submitted</code>. And when the <code>submit</code> event is called, the <code>Book::Order</code> object&rsquo;s <code>state</code> will transition from one state to the other.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much all you really need to implement a state machine. But of course, we&rsquo;ve only got two states here, which isn&rsquo;t really much of a machine and definitely doesn&rsquo;t take advantage of all the functionalities that <code>aasm</code> provides us with.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s continue to build on the state machine based on <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Nd3ityK.png">the diagram</a> from last week&rsquo;s post and add a few more states and events:

<p>Whoa &ndash; now we&rsquo;re talking! This state machine is even more complex than the diagram we started off with!</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that we even have a <code>state :returned</code> and an <code>event :return</code>, which transition from a <code>complete</code> state to a <code>returned</code> one. And if you&rsquo;ve got a really good eye, you&rsquo;ll see that the <code>process</code> event has changed, too. Now, we can call the <code>process</code> event on the object when it&rsquo;s either in the <code>submitted</code> state or the <code>returned</code> state.</p>

<p>Our state machine is now a <em>self-referential</em> structure, which means that the <code>process</code> event looks back to states within the machine to determine whether it can continue forward or not. This all seems pretty cool, but you better buckle in &ndash; it&rsquo;s about to get <em>even cooler</em>.</p>

<h2>Test Driving Your Machine</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s lovely that we have this machine and all, but what&rsquo;s the fun if you can&rsquo;t take it out for a whirl? So, let&rsquo;s see what this thing can do.</p>

<p>This gem in particular provides us with a variety of public methods for any instances of our <code>Book::Order</code> class, all via our state machine:</p>

<pre><code>order = Book::Order.new # =&gt; =&gt; #&lt;Book::Order:0x007fad3d51aa30&gt;
order.unplaced?         # =&gt; true
order.may_submit?       # =&gt; true
order.submit            # calls the `submit` event

order.submitted?        # =&gt; true
order.unplaced?         # =&gt; false
order.may_submit?       # =&gt; false
order.submit            # =&gt; raises AASM::InvalidTransition
</code></pre>

<p><em>Protip</em>: If you&rsquo;re not a big fan of raising exceptions in your application, just add <code>aasm :whiny_transitions =&gt; false do</code> right inside of your class, and you&rsquo;ll return basic <code>boolean</code> values instead of exceptions.</p>

<p>Whew! So that&rsquo;s a lot of methods. But we didn&rsquo;t have to write <em>any</em> of them! Isn&rsquo;t that fantastic? Hopefully the usefulness of state machines is starting to come together now. Remember before we knew what a state machine was? How would we have had to handle all of this functionality?</p>

<p>We would&rsquo;ve had to do all of the following, multiple times:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make a migration that adds a <code>state</code> or <code>status</code> column in our <code>Book::Object</code> class, with a <code>string</code> value.</li>
<li>Give the <code>state</code> column an initial default value of <code>unplaced</code>.</li>
<li>Add an instance method called <code>unplaced?</code> with a <code>boolean</code> return value.</li>
<li>Add another instance method called <code>submit</code>, which changes the object&rsquo;s <code>state</code> property from <code>"unplaced"</code> to <code>"submitted"</code>.</li>
<li>Add yet <em>another</em> instance method called <code>submitted?</code>, with (at the very least), a single-line <code>if</code> conditional.</li>
<li>Add some more instance methods for good measure, all with some logic in them to keep track of our object&rsquo;s <code>state</code>.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 3-6 for every single new <code>state</code> we wanted to add.</li>
</ol>

<p><br></p>

<p>If we compare this horrifying list to our state machine, it&rsquo;s pretty clear that our machine takes care of all of this! Yes, it requires a little bit of setup when we create our class, but come on, it&rsquo;s like, four lines of code for each state! So much better. And you get all these methods for free! And they&rsquo;re pretty powerful, because we can call them anywhere in our code, on any instance of our object.</p>

<p>But can we customize this machine even further? Heck yes, we can!</p>

<h2>Trick Out Yo&#8217; Ride</h2>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve created a basic state machine, we can trick it out with any (or all!) of these options:</p>

<h3>1. Pass a block to an <code>event</code></h3>

<p>Whenever you want a specific event to call a particular method, simply pass a block to the method. The block will only be called if the transition occurs successfully.

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>These callbacks work exactly as you might think, hooking into either a state or an event. Before the <code>Order</code> switches states from <code>processed</code> to <code>shipped</code>, the <code>print_return_label</code> method will fire. But the <code>send_delete_confirmation</code> method will only be called after the <code>delete event</code> is finished &ndash; only after the transition from <code>processing</code> to <code>deleted</code> occurs successfully.</p>

<h3>3. Implement a guard</h3>

<p>If you want to only allow a transition if a particular condition is defined; if the guard returns <code>false</code>, the transition will be denied, and will either return <code>false</code> or raise an error.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">event :submit do
  transitions :from =&gt; :unplaced, :to =&gt; :submitted, :guard =&gt; :payment_successfully_processed?
end

def payment_successfully_processed?
  # Returns a truthy value based on
  # whether the user's credit card info
  # has been processed successfully or not
end
</code></pre>

<p>These are just three things you can do to spice up your state machine. Creating a state machine with this gem gives you a fair amount of flexibility. You can use multiple guards or build multiple transitions for a single event. As your state machine grows, you can call the <code>aasm.current_event</code> to keep track of where you are in your code.</p>

<p>Now that you know how to implement a state machine, hopefully you now realize the value in them and don&rsquo;t feel too intimidated. As long as you take it a step at a time, you can create your own state machine, with the exact kind of functionality your program needs. With that said, there&rsquo;s only one thing left to do: go forth implement one yourself! Fly young grasshopper, fly!</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>State machines can be broken down into <code>states</code> and <code>events</code>. Events control the flow of one <code>state</code> to another.</li>
<li>Each <code>event</code> has a <code>from</code> and a <code>to transition</code>. Only if a transition occurs successfully will an object&rsquo;s <code>state</code> change. You can manipulate how an event or transition works using callbacks, blocks, and guards.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.kurzweilai.net/images/flowchart.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<p>My favorite thing about programming is the fact that you never run out of opportunities to be completely floored. There&rsquo;s literally <em>always</em> either a concept, theory, framework, or language that you don&rsquo;t know. This is actually fantastic, because there&rsquo;s no dearth of opportunity when it comes to learning. And you always come head-to-head with these facts when you pair program with a more experienced developer.</p>

<p>One of the new concepts that I encountered this week was the idea of <strong>state machines</strong>, sometimes referred to as &ldquo;finite state machines&rdquo;. At first I thought that this was something unique to the gem that we are using in one of our large-scale applications, but it turns out it&rsquo;s not a Rails thing. In fact, it&rsquo;s not even a Ruby thing! It&rsquo;s a <em>Computer Science</em> thing; to be a bit more specific, it&rsquo;s a mathematical abstraction used to design complex algorithms. But for all intents and purposes, it&rsquo;s a Computer Science theory that we use almost all the time, whether we know it or not.</p>

<p>If you got through that paragraph without freaking out, you deserve a medal. All this CS theory sounds terrifying, right? Well, don&rsquo;t worry. For programming purposes, you don&rsquo;t actually need to think too much about how state machines are constructed and what&rsquo;s being abstracted away. Even though state machines can get incredibly complex, relatively quickly, let&rsquo;s not overwhelm ourselves; we only need to think about state machines in the context of programming. So we&rsquo;ll keep it simple and focus on what state machines are, how they work, and when to use them.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>State Machines: What Are They?</h2>

<p>A state machine is nothing more than a flow chart. And here&rsquo;s the thing about flowcharts: <em>they&rsquo;re everywhere</em>. If you think about it, a flowchart is just a way of controlling the flow of a set of actions. You have different conditions, and depending on your condition &ndash; or &ldquo;state&rdquo;, as we refer to it in programmatic terms &ndash; you&rsquo;ll take a certain action.</p>

<p>For example, if you&rsquo;re hungry, you&rsquo;ll eat some food, probably a slice of cheesecake. If you&rsquo;re still hungry, you&rsquo;ll eat another slice. When you&rsquo;re full, you&rsquo;ll stop eating cheesecake (LOL, like anyone could ever be &ldquo;too full&rdquo; from cheesecake). You have different states of being, and certain events trigger you to move from one state to another &ndash; from hungry, to less hungry, to completely full.</p>

<p>One of the simplest definitions that I found for state machines in the context of programming comes from a <a href="http://lamsonproject.org/docs/introduction_to_finite_state_machines.html">Lamson Project blog post</a> :</p>

<blockquote><p>A practical finite state machine is basically four things: 1) A bunch of functions, or things that need to get done. 2) A bunch of events, or reasons to call these functions. 3) Some piece of data that tracks the &ldquo;state&rdquo; this bunch of functions is in. 4) Code inside the functions that says how to &ldquo;transition&rdquo; or &ldquo;change&rdquo; into the next state for further processing.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the risk of sounding a bit philosophical, it all boils down to actions that are taken, and the reasons we take certain actions. State machines are how we keep track of different events, and control the flow between those events.</p>

<h2>A State Of Being: How to Use State Machines</h2>

<p>The best way of understanding <em>how</em> to use a state machine in your own application is by seeing an example of it in another application. A good place to start is usually a commonly-used, large-scale web application. Since we&rsquo;ve been using my bookstore application in <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/03/10/its-all-in-the-family-using-acts-as-tree/">prior blog posts</a>, we&rsquo;ll use another eCommerce example to understand state machines. Here&rsquo;s a very simplified example of a basic order processing state machine:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Nd3ityK.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>

<p>If we follow the event flow, we start to get an idea of the different actions that trigger different states. Each <code>Order</code> starts off with an initial state (something that we&rsquo;ll explore a bit more when we build our own state machine), and requires a certain event to occur for its state to change. This means that only if an <code>Order</code> is <em>placed</em>, will the <code>Order</code>&rsquo;s state be changed to <code>submitted</code>.</p>

<p>The event triggers are important because without them, there wouldn&rsquo;t be enough clarity to move from one state to another. Take a look at the <code>Order</code> when it&rsquo;s in the <code>processing</code> state. The <code>Order</code> must be either <code>fulfilled</code> or <code>canceled</code> in order for it to proceed to the next state.</p>

<p>This particular state machine is <em>very</em> simple, and doesn&rsquo;t even account for the return or refund process! Imagine what that might look like! You could have states that could have events that <em>refer back</em> to themselves, which would make them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graphs</a>. Things would start to get really complicated, really fast.</p>

<p>But, if we think back to the Lamson Project&rsquo;s definition of a state machine, our order processing example still fits the bill:</p>

<ol>
<li>Our <strong>functions</strong>, the stuff that needs to get done, are the different things that need to happen for an event to trigger. For example, the <code>User</code> has to input a valid credit card number, cvv, expiration date, and shipping address just so that the <code>Order</code> can transition from <code>unplaced</code> to <code>submitted</code>.</li>
<li>Our <strong>events</strong>, the reasons to call the functions, are the actual actions taken during the flow of the machine. The <code>User</code> actually has to successfully <em>submit</em> the form and the data has to be passed from the <code>User</code> and stored in the database so that the event can successfully occur.</li>
<li>Our <strong>states</strong>, the data that tracks these functions, are the different conditions that our order can be in. If the <code>Order</code> is <code>processing</code>, all the functionality of fulfilling, packaging, and shipping the order must all be contained within that state.</li>
<li>Our <strong>code inside the functions</strong> would be all the intricate methods that do all the work prior to each event occurring and each state changing. For example, you&rsquo;d probably have a validation to check whether the user had input a valid zip code (something like <code>validates :zip_code_length</code>) before transitioning from an <code>unplaced</code> <code>Order</code> to a <code>submitted</code> one. And you&rsquo;d probably want to execute an <code>in_stock?</code> method before switching from the <code>processing</code> state to the <code>shipped</code> state.</li>
</ol>


<h2>The Case For State Machines</h2>

<p>While understanding state machines is great, is it always the right tool for the job? From my research and reading, it seems like most of the time, it is. <a href="http://www.skorks.com/2011/09/why-developers-never-use-state-machines/">This post</a> by Alan Skorkin gives some pretty good insight into <em>why</em> developers never use state machines. Many developers seem to be intimidated by the very concept of state machines, or sometimes don&rsquo;t even understand them in the first place, which can be cause to avoid them at all costs. Other programmers see them as complex and overly complicated, and perhaps not necessary when you&rsquo;re first starting off in building your application. And sometimes it&rsquo;s just hard to foresee how your application is going to grow, and determine whether or not a state machine is the right tool for the job.</p>

<p>Even though setting up a state machine takes a bit of initial effort, it can save you a lot of pain in the long run. Even though many programmers can&rsquo;t predict when they&rsquo;ll need a state machine, almost every application has some form of flow that fits the bill. And let&rsquo;s face it: almost every web application these days actually strives to <em>do</em> something, which means that it will inevitably have some sort of flow of events.</p>

<p>This fantastic <a href="http://www.shopify.com/technology/3383012-why-developers-should-be-force-fed-state-machines">Shopify blog post</a> makes a great case for why ever programmer needs to be &ldquo;force-fed&rdquo; the state machine concept. The most important part of all of this debate, however, is understanding the state machine pattern. You have to understand the pattern first, and then you can figure out whether you need to spend the time in actually implementing it.</p>

<p>Thankfully, there are a few common red flags that indicate if this is the case:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A <code>state</code> or a <code>status</code> attribute on any of your objects: <code>Book::Order.first.status</code></p></li>
<li><p>Instance methods that return a <code>boolean</code> value: <code>Book::Order.first.shipped?</code></p></li>
<li><p>Records that are only valid for a certain period of time: <code>User::Membership.first.subscriptions #=&gt; "expired"</code></p></li>
</ol>


<p>If your code base has any of these, you can probably benefit from a state machine. I went back and looked at my old web apps, and found that each and every one of them had at least one, if not more, of these situations. In fact, almost every Rails application is bound to have some variation of these three different scenarios, which means that we should all learn how to use state machines and become better developers!</p>

<p>So how do you actually go about creating a state machine? Well, that&rsquo;s a whole other <del>game</del> blog post entirely. Tune in again next Tuesday, when I&rsquo;ll explore how to actually go about <em>implementing</em> a state machine in your Rails application! Get excited! Like this:</p>

<h2>tl;dr?</h2>

<ul>
<li>State machines control the flow of events in a web application by using certain events to trigger different states or conditions.</li>
<li>If you find that your app has methods like <code>state</code> or <code>status</code> and <code>shipped?</code> or <code>received?</code>, you should try using a state machine.</li>
