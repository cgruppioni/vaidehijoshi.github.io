<p>Up until two weeks ago, I had one great fear: <em>testing</em>. And, to be clear, when I say &ldquo;fear&rdquo;, what I actually mean is sheer terror.</p>

<p>My test-writing anxiety stems from the fact that I&rsquo;ve never really had to do it before. I mean, I&rsquo;ve had to make tons of tests <em>pass</em>, which means that I read other people&rsquo;s tests all the time. Yet I&rsquo;ve somehow made it thus far in my coding career without ever having to write relatively complex tests of my own. But that all changed a few weeks ago, when I was forced to finally confront my fear of testing.</p>

<p>The thing about conquering fears, however, is that usually involves doing the very thing that you&rsquo;re afraid of. So, I spent the better portion of a week learning how and when to write tests, all while encountering a couple painful bugs along the way. It was not a fun week, but the good news is that I can write a fully-functioning test suite now! And now that I know more about testing, I actually find it kind of fun &ndash; so fun, in fact, that I&rsquo;m going to share it with you!</p>

<p>There comes a time in the life of every developer when you stop thinking about whether your code works. Instead, you concern yourself with something else entirely: how <em>efficiently</em> your code works.</p>

<p>In fact, you can trace this back to Kent Beck&rsquo;s <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast">philosophy</a> of &ldquo;Make it work, make it right, make it fast.&rdquo; Once you&rsquo;ve got your code doing what you want it to do, you need to make it better. But what do you do with your improved code once you&rsquo;ve set it right? Make sure that it&rsquo;s working as fast as it possibly can, of course!</p>

<p>Code efficiency is a bit of an advanced topic, and I&rsquo;m definitely no expert in it. But I recently learned a pretty awesome querying method that&rsquo;s neither difficult to understand nor too complex to implement. In fact, this method has always been right under your nose, hidden inside of the magic that is ActiveRecord. So what is this magical method, exactly? Well, it&rsquo;s called <strong>includes</strong>, and once you start using it, you&rsquo;ll never make database queries the same way again.</p>

<p>It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. It was&hellip;refactoring time! Well it was for me yesterday, at least.</p>

<p>Refactoring your own code has a great payoff at the end, but boy, does it take some work to get there. Something I&rsquo;ve noticed about my own code recently is that I&rsquo;m now able to know that something needs to be refactored pretty easily. I&rsquo;ve been having a lot of gut feelings about parts of my code that just <em>feel</em> wrong, inefficient, and repetitive. The problem is, even though I know where my code is weak, I don&rsquo;t usually know <em>how</em> to go about making my code better.</p>

<p>And this is where making effective use of resources (read: The Art Of Effective Googling) comes quite in handy. Yesterday, however, I used even better resource &ndash; a more experienced developer! We took a look at my code and came up with some ways I could refactor it. I learned about a pretty interesting module that could save me lines of code and keep my application <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>. And now I get to share it with you! This module is called <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/forwardable/rdoc/Forwardable.html">Forwardable</a>, and trust me when I say that it&rsquo;s going to make you want to delegate all the things.</p>

<p><em>This blog post is part of a series on State Machines. Read Part 1 <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/03/17/a-machine-state-of-mind-part-1-understanding-state-machines/">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>Until you encounter a state machine in a gem, framework, or within someone else&rsquo;s code, you probably won&rsquo;t find one very easily. But as we learned last week, they&rsquo;re rather pervasive. I discovered state machines while helping build a large-scale eCommerce website.</p>

<p>But there actually weren&rsquo;t even that many state machines in our code! We were relying on state machines that lived in the source code of a Rails library with a variety of gems, commonly referred to as <a href="https://github.com/spree">spree</a>. (Why reinvent ecommerce platforms when so many people have already made &lsquo;em, amirite?)</p>

<p>So, I did what any self-respecting, completely unaware new developer would do: I dove into the spree source code. And boy, was <em>that</em> a rabbit hole. But, I learned some things about how state machines work in Rails and how to make them. It&rsquo;s good to conceptually understand the theory behind state machines, but the best way to learn something is by doing it. It&rsquo;s time to take off the training wheels and actually <em>build</em> our own state machine!</p>

<p>My favorite thing about programming is the fact that you never run out of opportunities to be completely floored. There&rsquo;s literally <em>always</em> either a concept, theory, framework, or language that you don&rsquo;t know. This is actually fantastic, because there&rsquo;s no dearth of opportunity when it comes to learning. And you always come head-to-head with these facts when you pair program with a more experienced developer.</p>

<p>One of the new concepts that I encountered this week was the idea of <strong>state machines</strong>, sometimes referred to as &ldquo;finite state machines&rdquo;. At first I thought that this was something unique to the gem that we are using in one of our large-scale applications, but it turns out it&rsquo;s not a Rails thing. In fact, it&rsquo;s not even a Ruby thing! It&rsquo;s a <em>Computer Science</em> thing; to be a bit more specific, it&rsquo;s a mathematical abstraction used to design complex algorithms. But for all intents and purposes, it&rsquo;s a Computer Science theory that we use almost all the time, whether we know it or not.</p>

<p>If you got through that paragraph without freaking out, you deserve a medal. All this CS theory sounds terrifying, right? Well, don&rsquo;t worry. For programming purposes, you don&rsquo;t actually need to think too much about how state machines are constructed and what&rsquo;s being abstracted away. Even though state machines can get incredibly complex, relatively quickly, let&rsquo;s not overwhelm ourselves; we only need to think about state machines in the context of programming. So we&rsquo;ll keep it simple and focus on what state machines are, how they work, and when to use them.</p>

<p>When working in Rails, it&rsquo;s all the family &ndash; literally. No matter the size of your application, almost all of your objects are going to be related to each other. You can create however many objects you wan because database rows are cheap, cheap, cheap! But the more objects you make, the harder it is to keep track of the other data that the object relates to (which is generally yet <em>another</em> object).</p>

<p>I found myself in such a predicament last week, when I had to make numerous objects relate to one other to create a tree structure. The obvious first approach was to use the <code>belongs_to</code> and <code>has_many</code> relationship. But when I realized that I wanted some <code>Genre</code> objects to belong to <em>other</em> <code>Genre</code> objects, I ran into a problem. Depending solely on the ActiveRecord relationships turned out to be painful, messy, and complicated, and wouldn&rsquo;t make my code very flexible or sustainable over time.</p>

<p>So I Googled around and found a handy plugin created by DHH himself called <code>acts_as_tree</code>. This gem allows you to create a hierarchical structure of objects in your application and &ndash; to take it a step further &ndash; gives you a bunch of incredibly helpful methods. It even allows you to visualize your tree structure! Sound amazing? That&rsquo;s because it is. And if you follow a few easy steps, you can use it in your application, too.</p>

<p>Snowmageddon. Snowpocalypse. The Deep Freeze of 2015. You can call it whatever you want, but we can all agree on one thing: it&rsquo;s so damn cold outside. In fact, it&rsquo;s so cold that I recently saw this error message while debugging a Postgres issue:
<code>RuntimeError: can't modify frozen Hash</code></p>

<p>My first thought was, naturally, <em>holy shit, even my hashes are frozen</em>. I did a little digging, and it turns out that we aren&rsquo;t the only ones susceptible to these chilly temperatures. Apparently, objects can also freeze!</p>

<p>So, in honor of the frozen tundra that we all seem to currently inhabit, I decided to explore the icy-cold depths of Rails frozen objects. Before you read on though, you should know: I&rsquo;m going to use only gifs from the Disney animated film, <em>Frozen</em> — don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn you.</p>

<p>I recently stumbled upon this line of code that totally floored me. I mean, I had to drop everything I was doing and do some serious Googling, my friends. Well, that and also I asked my fellow developers at work who are far more seasoned programmers than me.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m going to share this line of code with you, but you&rsquo;ve got to try not to totally freak out if you haven&rsquo;t seen it before. Are you ready? Ok, here we go:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Are you with me? Did you make it past the second line? Do I need to call an ambulance? Well, if your reaction was anything like mine, you saw <code>class &lt;&lt; self</code> and experienced something akin to an aneurysm.</p>

<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s agree on one thing right here, right now: everything in Ruby is an object. No matter how crazy it&rsquo;s about to get, just remember that. In fact, it&rsquo;s worth repeating again: <em>Everything in Ruby is an object &ndash; <strong>even a class</strong>.</em></p>

<p>Got it? Okay, now let&rsquo;s figure what the hell that code means, exactly.</p>

<p>No matter where you&rsquo;re from, what programming language you prefer, or which JavaScript framework you&rsquo;re committed to, I think you&rsquo;ll agree with me on one thing: time is a bitch. And no, I don&rsquo;t mean the wrinkles on your forehead kind of time (although that sucks too); I&rsquo;m talking about time as a programming concept.</p>

<p>I mean, you create some migrations, build some models, make some API calls, but then time shows up and brings down the party. I happened to learn all about programming&rsquo;s royal pain in the ass while working with the <a href="http://instagram.com/developer/">Instagram API</a> last week. After I finally got my code working, I took a look at my JSON response and saw this strange creature:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>"created_time": "1423694433"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t know what that was either. So I went down the rabbit hole and learned about all the different things there are to know about dealing with time in your Rails applications. So save yourself some time (HAHA get it, get it?) and get the lowdown below.</p>

<p>Mo money, mo problems. This is especially the case when you&rsquo;re a new developer trying to onboard onto a huge eCommerce Rails application.</p>

<p>No, but really - money is such a pain in the ass to deal with as a programmer. So much logic and detail goes into accepting a payment, processing a transaction, checking an order&rsquo;s status&hellip;and don&rsquo;t even get me <em>started</em> on shipping &ndash; seriously, I&rsquo;m saving the entire concept of shipping for another blog post.</p>

<p>But, at some point or another, you have to deal with other people&rsquo;s money. And you have to try and not screw it up, because apparently people really don&rsquo;t like that. So, how do you handle all those dolla dolla bills? Yup, you guessed it: with the <strong>money-rails library</strong> and Ruby&rsquo;s <strong>BigDecimal object</strong>.</p>
