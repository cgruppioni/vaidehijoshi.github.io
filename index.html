<p>Ah, authorization &ndash; or as I like to call it, authentication&rsquo;s cooler, slightly less complicated twin. It&rsquo;s easy to confuse the two, but there&rsquo;s a fundamental difference between them. I recently learned that while setting up an authorization system for an application that&rsquo;s nearing the end of development. Authentication focuses on who you are as a user &mdash; an admin, guest, or user with an account, for example &mdash; while authorization is about what actions you can take. Authorization centers around what you are actually <em>able to do</em> within the context of your role.</p>

<p>It often makes sense to leave authorization as one of the later (and sometimes, last) step of development, purely because it means that you don&rsquo;t need to worry about making sure that you are authenticated in your development environment while you are still building out your application. But eventually, somewhere between development and deployment, you&rsquo;ll have to think about the abilities of your users &mdash; or, what they can and can&rsquo;t do.</p>

<p>There are a few different ways to go about creating an authorization system, one of the most popular being <code>can_can</code>, a gem that has been around in the Rails community since 2010, as well as a newer gem called <code>rolify</code>. But the one that I&rsquo;ve found really easy and fun to work with is <code>pundit</code>, an <a href="https://github.com/elabs/pundit">authorization system</a> crafted by eLabs, and interestingly enough, based off of the logic and thought behind the CanCan&rsquo;s approach. The developers at eLabs actually started off using the CanCan library in their own applications, but quickly realized that it could become very complicated, very quickly. So, they built the simpler authorization system of <code>pundit</code>, which is exactly what we&rsquo;ll play around with today!</p>

<p>With the advent of Rails 4.2, one thing is definitely for sure: there is now one background job to rule them all: Active Job. Last week, I learned about Active Job&rsquo;s <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/09/15/working-hard-or-hardly-working-part-1-active-job/">easy integration</a> with ActionMailer. But, as nice as it is to have those simple <code>deliver_now</code> and <code>deliver_later</code> methods, there will inevitably be a time that we want to do something more &mdash; something that requires writing our own custom job.</p>

<p>Active Job is, thankfully, very good at letting us do this. Since my ActionMailer post last week, I&rsquo;ve written a few jobs using Active Job&rsquo;s framework. And each time that I&rsquo;ve done it, it&rsquo;s gotten easier and easier. Of course, not all of my jobs have been super complex, but once I understood the basics, I could look at other people&rsquo;s code and understand how it was structure and what exactly was going on.</p>

<p>The only way to get comfortable writing my own custom jobs was by &ndash; wait for it &ndash; actually <em>writing</em> one! So that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;ll do together. Let&rsquo;s turn our ActionMailer method from last week into its own job that will be able to run asychronously. Hold on to your hats, because we&rsquo;re about to leave the shire.</p>

<p>Last week, I sent a lot of emails &mdash; after all, I was working on creating my <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/09/08/youve-got-mail-action-mailer-plus-letter-opener/">very first mailer</a>. But in the process, I also realized something else: waiting for an email to send is <em>not</em> fun. Especially if you can&rsquo;t do anything else while you&rsquo;re waiting.</p>

<p>This problem pretty much encapsculates the reason for the existence and invention of background jobs. I&rsquo;ve actually been playing around with creating and running jobs in different applications for the past few months now, yet I never really felt comfortable with them. I knew that having jobs run certain processes was clearly very important since they kept popping up all over the place. However, I was having trouble wrapping my head around what exactly a background job <em>was</em>, and when and why I would ever need to use one.</p>

<p>Working with ActionMailer turned out to be the perfect stepping-stone to Active Job, which helped me to better understand inline processes, asychronous requests, and how all of these things fit into running a job. Since we already know how to create mailers, that will be the perfect introduction to running our very first job! Integrating ActionMailer and Active Job is a piece of cake, so we&rsquo;ll start with that first. Baby steps, my friends!</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s one thing that everyone loves: getting mail! But there&rsquo;s one thing that all developers would rather avoid: sending mail. Unfortunately, this paradox perfectly describes the joys and horrors of getting your application to send a single email.</p>

<p>I recently worked on building out a password reset feature for one of our applications. In order for this feature to work, I had to figure out how to get my Rails application to send an email to our user with a password reset token in case they had forgotten their password. I thought that handling the authentication and token aspect of this would be complicated, but it turned out that learning about mailers was the more fun part. I had never actually worked with Rails mailers before, and honestly, I thought that I was in over my head (this also might be partly attributed to the fact that I had just come back from a two-week vacation and felt like I had completely forgotten how to code).</p>

<p>So, I did what any developer would do: I cried and went home. Okay, okay, I&rsquo;m just kidding! What I <em>actually</em> did was read through the documentation, play around with my application and, in the process, taught myself how to use Rails Action Mailer. I never thought that I&rsquo;d say this but, getting that feature to work and seeing that email pop up was incredibly exciting. In fact, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever been more excited about sending and receiving an email. But don&rsquo;t let me tell you how thrilling it was &mdash; let&rsquo;s create our own mailer and experience it together!</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Words are pretty important. But do you know what&rsquo;s more important than words? <em>Grammar</em>. (Can you tell that I was an English major?) Despite how big of a book nerd I am, there&rsquo;s acually a crucial reason as to why we should keep things like grammar in consideration: convention.</p>

<p>At it&rsquo;s very core &mdash; pun totally intended &mdash; the Rails framework is based in conventions. We rely on the framework to create our models, controllers, and views in a specific file structure, and for them to be named in a certain way. But what we often forget is that we also rely on Rails to be smart enough to handle strange edge cases, like knowing that a <code>mice</code> table should store the <code>Mouse</code> model objects, and that the <code>MiceController</code> should be responsible for passing those objects back and forth!</p>

<p>It all seems pretty automagical. But we have to keep in mind that it was the Rails core team that created and established these conventions, which means that they&rsquo;re not magic &mdash; they&rsquo;re just code! And as much as we can rely on preexisting Rails conventions, there might be times that we need to tweak our code to abide by those conventions. And because computers are not people (and because English is a crazy language with so many strange exceptions), we&rsquo;re probably going to run into a roadblock when dealing with grammar naming conventions. Thankfully, there&rsquo;s a great tool to help with this problem: the Rails <strong>Inflector</strong>, also known as every grammar nerd&rsquo;s dream.</p>

<p>I recently went down a little bit of rabbit hole in order to do some <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/08/18/safer-sql-using-activerecord-transactions/">digging on database transactions</a>. And when I say &ldquo;a little bit&rdquo;, I mostly mean &ldquo;a lot bit&rdquo;. I opened up the Rails source code for <code>ActiveRecord::Transactions</code>, and I saw some interesting terms I hadn&rsquo;t seen in awhile.</p>

<p>Back when I was first learning Ruby a year ago, I remember reading about keywords. At the time, the only thing that <em>really</em> set them apart for me was the fact that they had special syntax highlighting in my text editor! (Yes, really.) But when I saw them again in the Rails source code, I thought it would be time to get a quick refresher on a few keywords that I saw again and again.</p>

<p>But first: what <em>are</em> keywords, exactly? Well, they&rsquo;re definitely not objects, but instead are reserved words, which are actually <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/9446185">defined in the Ruby parser</a>. In fact, there&rsquo;s a whole slew of keywords in Ruby, but the ones that I&rsquo;m the most interested in sharing with you are <code>begin</code>, <code>end</code>, <code>ensure</code>, and <code>rescue</code>. So let&rsquo;s start unlock the door to Ruby with these keywords!</p>

<p>Is there anything more satisfying than writing concise, perfect line of SQL and then watching it query your database exactly as you expected? Probably not. Writing &mdash; and subsequently watching! &mdash; an efficient database query is one of my favorite parts of building an application.</p>

<p>But if there&rsquo;s one thing about software development that I&rsquo;ve learned over the past few months, it&rsquo;s this: projects can get out of control, rather quickly. You start off with your basic models, but then as you add one feature after another, things can start to get out of hand. At that point, your focus as a developer shifts and spreads out to various things. You can&rsquo;t just care about how readable your code is; you also have to consider how efficient it is, and how different units of your application might be breaking other parts (hopefully not unbeknownst to you!). In other words, you have to consider how defensive and <em>safe</em> your code actually is.</p>

<p>Recently, while writing some background jobs and creating some service objects for a new feature, I realized the importance of executing and enforcing safe code. The good news is that there&rsquo;s a really helpful, life-saving ActiveRecord <strong>transaction</strong> method that allows you to do exactly this. And the really great news? You get to watch your SQL queries execute safely as a result!</p>

<p>Sometimes, it&rsquo;s the little things that matter the most. As cool and complex as your giant application might be, small details like a toggleable button, or beautiful-formatted and styled dropdown select can have the biggest impact on the look and feel of the rest of your application.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve built out the skeleton of your application and filled in the backend functionality, the next step is to connect the all the logic with your frontend framework. And once you&rsquo;ve done that, you start to see all the gaping holes that you need to fix next. One of the applications that I have been working on recently got to that state. Once I ensured that the user-facing page corresponded to the admin panel, it was time to fix all the little things that I had been putting off until we got the application working!</p>

<p>One of those minute details was rendering markdown. While building out the application, we were just using Ruby string primitives in our database to render text. But no one wants to see a long five-paragraph article rendered as a single, huge block of text, right? So, we had to make our text easily editable on the admin panel and renderable &mdash; that&rsquo;s word, right? &mdash; on the user-facing side. At first, I had no idea how to go about doing this. But it turns out that (no surprise here!) this problem has been solved before! All we had to do next was figure out how to implement someone else&rsquo;s solution on our own application. Luckily, the answer to our prayers is as simple as rolling out the <code>redcarpet</code> gem.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We all know how this scene plays out: you&rsquo;ve created the first iteration of your application and you&rsquo;re ready to test it out in production. You can&rsquo;t wait to see what it looks like live, and you want people to be able to start playing with it! Everything seems to go smoothly without any glitches while deploying until you go to your app on Heroku and see&hellip;<em>a broken image icon</em>. Tada!</p>

<p>This happened to me recently, and boy was it disheartening. I was all excited because I had used <code>paperclip</code> to get some pretty cool <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/07/28/clipping-images-for-rails-using-paperclip/">image uploading functionality</a> on my application, but it didn&rsquo;t seem like it was working. It turns out, however, that an application in development is one thing; the same app in production is another game entirely.</p>

<p>While developing an application, our environments are configured in a certain way. It&rsquo;s easy to forget that things will change once we deploy what we&rsquo;ve been working on. Being able to implement something like the <code>paperclip</code> gem in development doesn&rsquo;t easily carry over to your production environment &ndash; unless, of course, you know what tool to use. Luckily, there&rsquo;s a great gem that was created specifically to make the transition from development to production quick and easy: the <code>aws-sdk</code> gem, Amazon Web Services&#8217; Software Development Kit that was created to use with Rails applications for storing your static assets in your AWS Simple Storage bucket. And once you know how to set it up with your Heroku account, you can get rid of that pesky broken image icon once and for all!</p>

<p>They say that a picture is worth a thousand words. How they came up with a such a nice, conveniently specific number number I&rsquo;ll never know. But what I do know is that everything on the web is just data floating around in cyberspace. And when I say everything, I really do mean <em>everything</em> &ndash; including pictures!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worked on a few different projects that have required building out an interface to allow a user or an admin to upload images. The first time that I had to do this, I knew that there were a few different Rails gems out there to help make this magic happen. But I didn&rsquo;t really understand what was going on when I implemented these gems the first time around. To be quite honest, the first time I had to implement file uploading, I just followed the setup steps rather blindly. Now that I&rsquo;ve had to solve the same problem multiple times, however, I feel a bit more comfortable with the process.</p>

<p>There are a few different gems out there for handing file attachment in Rails, but my favorite one to use so far has been <strong>paperclip</strong>. Created by the super cool developers over at <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip">ThoughtBot</a>, the paperclip gem is fairly simple and straightforward to use. The reason that I like this gem in particular is that it fits seamlessly into the Rails framework. Files and attachments are treated just like an attribute on an ActiveRecord object, which makes the setup process both easy and intuitive. However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s not intimidating at first! Luckily, we&rsquo;re going to walk through using the paperclip gem together.</p>
