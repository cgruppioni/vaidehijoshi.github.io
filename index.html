<p>I&rsquo;ve been rather reflective this past week. This is mostly because the end of this year of technical Tuesdays is now very much in sight, with only a handful more posts left to write. Also, I&rsquo;ve been going back over old posts and correcting a few spelling and code snippet mistakes that have been brought to my attention (shoutout to all of you who have been proofreading for me!). All of this is to say that I never realized until recently that I&rsquo;ve covered quite the spread of different topics over the past year!</p>

<p>But here&rsquo;s the rub: I&rsquo;m not even <em>close</em> to being done with my list of things I still want to learn more about. And even though that list keeps growing, I&rsquo;ve noticed that the complexity behind the concepts I&rsquo;m learning and writing about has begun to slowly change. While I started off focusing on syntax and DSL-specific topics, now those topics have become more theoretical in nature. While I used to write about things like the Rails <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/06/09/refactoring-to-reveal-rails-group-by/">group_by</a> method and the <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/06/02/code-smells-and-ruby-shorthand-unpacking-ampersand-plus-to-proc/">ampersand</a> operator, now I&rsquo;m diving into more complex concepts like <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/12/01/functions-to-call-upon-activerecord-association-callbacks/">association callbacks</a> and <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/07/07/taskmanaging-your-app-part-2-service-objects/">service objects</a>.</p>

<p>This week took complex concepts to a whole new level. I&rsquo;m talking about higher-level CS theory that I didn&rsquo;t even know existed. It all started when I heard someone use the term <strong>&ldquo;pub-sub&rdquo;</strong> (yeah, that&rsquo;s a thing!). And it stands for <strong>publish-subscribe</strong>, which is a messaging pattern used in software architecture. If you&rsquo;ve never heard about this before, don&rsquo;t worry &mdash; I hadn&rsquo;t either! It&rsquo;s apparently not all that common in Rails development, but <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">JavaScript promises</a> are a loose example for how they are constructed. But let&rsquo;s not get carried away with semicolons and such nonesense. How does the publish-subscribe pattern work in Ruby? It&rsquo;s time to learn all about it!</p>

<p>No developer knows <em>everything</em> &mdash; even if they do know a whole lot more than you do. I was reminded of this fact recently while pairing with a more experienced programmer on a large Ember-Rails project that&rsquo;s now coming to a close. We were right in the middle of adding some methods to a Rails model when we realized that we actually needed to change something about how one of our model&rsquo;s <code>ActiveRecord</code> associations worked.</p>

<p>What we wanted to do was rely upon a callback function executing every time an association was created or destroyed. But, we hit a little bit of a wall, since we quickly realized that this wasn&rsquo;t as simple as we initially thought. The complication came with the fact that we were dealing with a <code>has_many</code> relationship, which meant that we weren&rsquo;t dealing with a single object, but rather a <em>collection</em> of objects. The developer I was pairing with explained that he knew that there were some methods that <code>ActiveRecord</code> has to achieve what we wanted to do, but he wasn&rsquo;t sure how they worked exactly, just that he had seen them before elsewhere.</p>

<p>After doing a little research on what resources <code>ActiveRecord</code> provides when it comes to solving this problem in an elegant way, we eventually decided to go another route and use a different callback function. But in the process of pairing, we learned that there <em>are</em> some methods that exist in <code>ActiveRecord</code> that can come in handy in this situation. If we hadn&rsquo;t been on a tight deadline for the specific feature that we were building, we probably could have devoted more time to learning about these callbacks. So, I decided to come back to these callback functions and dig a little deeper. Interestingly, there really isn&rsquo;t that much documentation on <code>ActiveRecord</code>&rsquo;s association callback methods, and nearly no blog posts. This is uncharted territory, my friends! Are you ready? I hope so.</p>

<p><em>This blog post is part of a series on strong parameters. Read Part 1 <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/11/17/peeking-under-the-hood-of-actioncontroller-parameters-part-1/">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>Rails often feels like a black box, with all of the complex logic abstracted away and hidden from view. This leaves behind a clean, convention-abiding framework where form follows function. But another, perhaps less-intentional side effect of all the &ldquo;metaprogramming away&rdquo; of this framework&rsquo;s complexities is a frequent lack on clarity of what&rsquo;s going on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>In my year of working with Rails, I&rsquo;ve come to appreciate and respect so many things about it. In fact, I think that there&rsquo;s something incredibly approachable about Ruby as one&rsquo;s first programming language, with Rails as its corresponding framework. And of course, there&rsquo;s something truly unique and welcoming about the Ruby and Rails programming community. All of these factors combined make it so easy for beginners of such different backgrounds to start building applications very quickly.</p>

<p>However, once you get past the intial stage of building applications with the basic CRUD operations, or if you&rsquo;re trying to build something a bit more complex  with added functionality, or trying to integrate with another framework, you eventually hit a wall where you realize that that you&rsquo;re not completely sure how something works. This can be a hard wall to climb over, especially given the fact that you can start building things very quickly with Rails. Some people have heavily critiqued this aspect of the framework, arguing that it&rsquo;s detrimential to abstract away so much of what&rsquo;s <em>actually</em> going on, which makes it difficult for people to understand what their code is truly doing under the hood. I&rsquo;ve peronally encountered this &ldquo;wall of abstraction&rdquo; a few different times, but each time I found some piece of logic that worked differently than I thought it would, it only lead me to learn something new about the framework. Most recently, that lead me down a wild goose chase into the source code for <code>ActionController::Parameters</code> &mdash; a class that I didn&rsquo;t even know existed!</p>

<p>When you write code every day for a living, it&rsquo;s easy to get hyper-focused on building out new features and getting things done quickly. What&rsquo;s much harder is to take a step back and figure out exactly how something is working. Of course, sometimes this happens inherently and without any effort on your part &mdash; say for example, when you&rsquo;re fixing a bug or need to integrate with a third-party service and are forced to understand what&rsquo;s happening on a more granular level. But generally speaking, that is less common when you&rsquo;re working a within a framework that you&rsquo;re already comfortable with and use daily, without giving it a second thought.</p>

<p>I had one of those &ldquo;take a step back and question everything&rdquo; kind of moments recently. I was writing a controller for the admin interface of a Rails application, and hit a roadblock. To be clear, there wasn&rsquo;t anything super complex about the controller I was writing; it had the basic CRUD actions that any controller does, and I had written controllers like it plenty of times before. Yet somehow, when I got to writing the <code>params</code> private method for this controller, I couldn&rsquo;t remember what methods I needed to use. I was super tempted to open up another controller and just copy and paste the strong parameters from one file into another. But I realized that this wasn&rsquo;t really going to help me at all. What I <em>really</em> needed to do was grasp how strong parameters worked on a more conceptual level. If I could understand why we use the methods that we use, and to what end, I would never need to even look up the documentation for whitelisting parameters ever again!</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s exactly what I did. I decided to peek under the hood of Rails&#8217; <code>ActionController</code>, and set my mind to learning everything there was the know about strong parameters. <em>Spoiler alert:</em> I didn&rsquo;t completely succeed, and I definitely don&rsquo;t know everything about whitelisting parameters. But what I <em>did</em> finally come to understand was why we use the methods that we do (think <code>require</code> and <code>permit</code>), and why we invoke them in that order. And hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to explain how some that black box magic in Rails <em>actually</em> works!</p>

<p>A couple of months ago, I wrote <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/08/25/unlocking-ruby-keywords-begin-end-ensure-rescue/">a blog post</a> on some basic Ruby keywords including <code>begin</code>, <code>end</code>, <code>rescue</code>, and <code>ensure</code>. A few days after publishing said post, another Rubyist friend of mine sent me a message telling me to read about memoization. &ldquo;You basically describe memoization in your post without ever explicitly explaining it,&rdquo; she had said. At the time, I had added it to my ever-growing list of &ldquo;things to learn more about&rdquo;, but promptly forgot to make the time to learn about the concept.</p>

<p>Cut to last week, when I was trying to write a controller action that had to do something a bit more complex than simply render a JSON-formatted response of a given resource. So, I started off by implementing a <code>begin</code> <code>end</code> block to execute a bunch of code that needed to run on it&rsquo;s own. I remembered writing about how to use these two keywords, so I pulled up my post and was suddenly reminded of&hellip;<strong>memoization</strong>. It turned out that I actually needed to use memoization in this controller action, and had already been using it elsewhere in the very same project! But, I still didn&rsquo;t understand what it was, or in what way I had been using it so far.</p>

<p>After putting it off for months, it was finally time to learn about this memoization business. For those of us (myself included!) who haven&rsquo;t quite gotten the memo on memoization, here&rsquo;s the brief lowdown: the term dates back to the year 1968, when it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">coined by</a> Donald Michie, a British artificial intelligence researcher who worked alongside Alan Turing at the Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park during WWII. The basic idea of a memoization function is that it can &ldquo;remember&rdquo; the result that corresponds to a set of given inputs. In other words, it can store the results of an expensive function call by &ldquo;saving&rdquo; the result such that when you call the same function again with the same parameters, you don&rsquo;t need to rerun the function. In the context of computer science specifically, this is a kind of optimization technique that is used to make programs more efficient and much faster. There are a few different ways that memoization pops up in Ruby and Rails, which is exactly what we&rsquo;ll need to learn about next!</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Over the past forty or so Tuesdays &mdash; has it really been that many?! &mdash; I&rsquo;ve written on a spread of topics. There&rsquo;s a slight problem with this: sometimes I forget what I have and haven&rsquo;t written about. Here&rsquo;s a case in point for you: last week, I wrote about <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/10/27/digging-into-the-finder-object-pattern/">finder objects</a>, and casually tossed in some scopes into my models. It turns out, I&rsquo;ve never actually written about how scopes work, or what they really do!</p>

<p>I know, I know, that&rsquo;s pretty terrible of me. I actually learned about scopes awhile ago, and now I use them fairly often in my applications. However, I got so used to writing them, that I never really thought that much about how they work behind the scenes. In fact, when I sat down to write <em>this</em> post, I had to go on a hunt into the Rails source code and Ruby blogosphere to figure out what was going on under the hood every single time I implemented a scope in my code.</p>

<p>The main reason that I like to use <strong>ActiveRecord scopes</strong> is because they allow us to specify commonly-used queries, but encapsulate these queries into methods, which we can then call on our models or association objects. However, my hunt lead me to find out that scopes have been around for awhile in Railsland, so they&rsquo;re not exactly that new. But, what&rsquo;s interesting about them is how their implementation has changed and grown with different releases of Rails. There&rsquo;s also a lot of debate over how and when scopes are different from their counterparts, or simpler class methods. But what makes a scope exactly? Well, it&rsquo;s finally time for us to hunt down the answer to that question.</p>

<p>Most developers aren&rsquo;t ever <em>completely</em> happy with their code. I&rsquo;m no exception to this stereotype &mdash; I almost always know that I could probably write a cleaner, more concise method, controller, or class. Usually, it&rsquo;s a matter of not know the best tool to reach for to refactor my code; eventually, I learn a new pattern or form of encapuslating logic that I later use to make my old code a lot better.</p>

<p>But a few weeks ago, I wrote 100 lines of beautiful code. I&rsquo;m talking about a goregous, straightforward, no-nonsense class that did a lot in a relatively few lines of Ruby. I still feel pretty proud of it (can you tell?), and part of the reason for this is because I also learned a new pattern while writing this class. I was actually pairing with another developer, and we wanted to try using a rather common Rails pattern to solve a problem we were running into again and again: messy queries in our controllers and models.</p>

<p>We both were familiar with the concept of &ldquo;skinny controllers&rdquo; and &ldquo;fat models&rdquo;, or the idea that your controllers shouldn&rsquo;t be responsible for containing the logic specific to a model. However, we also didn&rsquo;t want our models to get out of control in size, which is exactly what was starting to happen. So, we searched for a workaround, and found our answer in one of the most elegant patterns I&rsquo;ve seen in awhile: <strong>finder objects</strong>. Finder objects are simple Ruby classes that encapuslate the logic behind querying the database, and they are hands down, my new favorite kind of Ruby object.</p>

<p>Last week was my first week of working from home, which meant two things: spending a lot of time with my computer and limited time with other human beings and, more importantly, debugging things on my own without having anyone nearby to ask for help. The latter of the two actually ended up reaffirming the fact that I actually <em>can</em> debug a decent amount of things on my own if I just power through and am stubborn enough to not give up.</p>

<p>I also learned something interesting about the debugging process: while we&rsquo;re learning, we often solve the same problem again and again. At least, this was the case for one of the features I was working on which involved using an object&rsquo;s slug to generate a url. As I started thinking through how to approach solving this, I immediately had the feeling that I had done something similar in another project. Digging through another repository&rsquo;s source code confirmed my suspicions, and I rediscovered the <code>stringex</code> gem and its multiple libraries, including <code>acts_as_url</code>!</p>

<p>All of this begs the question: why didn&rsquo;t I remember that this gem existed &mdash; or that I had already used it? My guess is that it&rsquo;s because I neither wrote about it nor understood how it worked until a few days ago. This week, it&rsquo;s time to rectify that situation and dive into the <code>acts_as_url</code> library and find a solution for all slug problems, once and for all!</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, while learning everything I never knew about <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/09/29/using-pundit-the-cool-kid-of-authorization/">user authorization</a>, I also stumbled upon a cool refactoring pattern that I didn&rsquo;t even know existed. This pattern is based on the simple idea of Ruby modules and mixins, but is particularly handy when it comes to dealing with class methods and callbacks.</p>

<p>ActiveSupport is a pretty massive component within Rails, and it&rsquo;s responsible for a ton of different functionality, including language extensions and utilities. I last wrote about ActiveSupport back when we were exploring the <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2015/09/01/inflections-everywhere-using-activesupport-inflector/">Rails inflector</a> and the libraries it provides for handling the pluralization of different strings. This was way back in September, and at the time, my understanding of ActiveSupport was pretty limited. It turns out that yes, ActiveSupport does provide a bunch of different patterns to transform simple Ruby strings&hellip;but it also has a lot more going on inside of it. For example, the <strong>ActiveSupport Concern module</strong>, which only recently made its debut in Rails 4.</p>

<p>The ActiveSupport::Concern wrapper is an interesting way of encapsulating&hellip;well, certain functionality that you might be <em>concerned</em> with. These concerns take advantage of two directories that are automatically part of the load path within a Rails application: <code>app/models/concerns</code> and <code>app/controllers/concerns</code>. So, how do you write a concern, and what should go inside of it? Don&rsquo;t worry, that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;ll concern ourselves with next.</p>

<p>There are times in a Ruby program or Rails application that one comes to a single realization: <em>Oh no, I need to deal with an external file!</em> For larger applications, this might manifest as a request to your Amazon S3 bucket for a file, which you then need to modify in some way, or perhaps just simply read and have access to. But sometimes, even a simple Ruby script or plain old Ruby class may need to read or write to an external file.</p>

<p>I honestly didn&rsquo;t know a lot about Ruby&rsquo;s File class (wait, Ruby has a <em>file</em> class?! Yes, yes it does.) until recently, when I had to handle a situation that would allow me to download files from a file storage service (such as S3), and then process the file locally on my machine. The process was a bit complicated, and I still think that I have more to learn about how it actually works. But, one thing that I <em>did</em> actually start to wrap my head around is <strong>Ruby Tempfiles</strong>. Yup, that&rsquo;s right: not only does Ruby have a <code>File</code> class &mdash; it also has a <code>Tempfile</code> class.</p>

<p>It turns out that these two classes intersect quite a bit, and it can be a little confusing to know how they differ. The only way to really understand Ruby&rsquo;s <code>Tempfile</code> class is to play around with it and create some tempfiles. So let&rsquo;s get filin&#8217;!</p>
