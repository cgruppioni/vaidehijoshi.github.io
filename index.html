<p>Snowmageddon. Snowpocalypse. The Deep Freeze of 2015. You can call it whatever you want, but we can all agree on one thing: it&rsquo;s so damn cold outside. In fact, it&rsquo;s so cold that I recently saw this error message while debugging a Postgres issue:
<code>RuntimeError: can't modify frozen Hash</code></p>

<p>My first thought was, naturally, <em>holy shit, even my hashes are frozen</em>. I did a little digging, and it turns out that we aren&rsquo;t the only ones susceptible to these chilly temperatures. Apparently, objects can also freeze!</p>

<p>So, in honor of the frozen tundra that we all seem to currently inhabit, I decided to explore the icy-cold depths of Rails frozen objects. Before you read on though, you should know: I&rsquo;m going to use only gifs from the Disney animated film, <em>Frozen</em> â€” don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This blog post is part of a series on Class Inheritence. Read Part 1 <a href="http://vaidehijoshi.github.io/blog/2014/10/16/class-inheritance/">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>I recently stumbled upon this line of code that totally floored me. I mean, I had to drop everything I was doing and do some serious Googling, my friends. Well, that and also I asked my fellow developers at work who are far more seasoned programmers than me.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m going to share this line of code with you, but you&rsquo;ve got to try not to totally freak out if you haven&rsquo;t seen it before. Are you ready? Ok, here we go:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">SomeObject</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">class</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="nb">self</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">some_method</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="s2">&quot;A string returned by some_method.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Are you with me? Did you make it past the second line? Do I need to call an ambulance? Well, if your reaction was anything like mine, you saw <code>class &lt;&lt; self</code> and experienced something akin to an aneurysm.</p>

<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s agree on one thing right here, right now: everything in Ruby is an object. No matter how crazy it&rsquo;s about to get, just remember that. In fact, it&rsquo;s worth repeating again: <em>Everything in Ruby is an object &ndash; <strong>even a class</strong>.</em></p>

<p>Got it? Okay, now let&rsquo;s figure what the hell that code means, exactly.</p>

<p>No matter where you&rsquo;re from, what programming language you prefer, or which JavaScript framework you&rsquo;re committed to, I think you&rsquo;ll agree with me on one thing: time is a bitch. And no, I don&rsquo;t mean the wrinkles on your forehead kind of time (although that sucks too); I&rsquo;m talking about time as a programming concept.</p>

<p>I mean, you create some migrations, build some models, make some API calls, but then time shows up and brings down the party. I happened to learn all about programming&rsquo;s royal pain in the ass while working with the <a href="http://instagram.com/developer/">Instagram API</a> last week. After I finally got my code working, I took a look at my JSON response and saw this strange creature:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>"created_time": "1423694433"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t know what that was either. So I went down the rabbit hole and learned about all the different things there are to know about dealing with time in your Rails applications. So save yourself some time (HAHA get it, get it?) and get the lowdown below.</p>

<p>Mo money, mo problems. This is especially the case when you&rsquo;re a new developer trying to onboard onto a huge eCommerce Rails application.</p>

<p>No, but really - money is such a pain in the ass to deal with as a programmer. So much logic and detail goes into accpeting a payment, processing a transaction, checking an order&rsquo;s status&hellip;and don&rsquo;t even get me <em>started</em> on shipping &ndash; seriously, I&rsquo;m saving the entire concept of shipping for another blog post.</p>

<p>But, at some point or another, you have to deal with other people&rsquo;s money. And you have to try and not screw it up, because apparently people really don&rsquo;t like that. So, how do you handle all those dolla dolla bills? Yup, you guessed it: with the <strong>money-rails library</strong> and Ruby&rsquo;s <strong>BigDecimal object</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>NERD ALERT: I love databases. God, they&rsquo;re just <em>fantastic</em>. Few things give me as much joy as an empty whiteboard and a couple of intricate join tables that need to be sketched out. But there&rsquo;s also an art to understanding how to handle data &ndash; particularly when you have a shit ton of it.</p>

<p>The main issue people run into with data is first, how to go about storing it, and second, how to go about getting it when you actually need it! This doesn&rsquo;t sound super complicated though, right? <em>Wrong</em>. Databases grow vertically, not horizontally, and they grow hella fast. At a certain point, the way that you go about storing your data ends up <em>directly impacting</em> how you go about retrieving it!</p>

<p>Many Rubyists write different helper methods to do their querying for them. But this is Rails Land, which means that we have <del>black</del> Rails magic at our disposal. And with the advent of Rails 4.1, that magic now has a name: <strong>enum</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, I started my very first job as a software engineer! It&rsquo;s been super exciting, slightly terrifying, and sometimes overwhelming. I think one of the trickiest parts of starting as a new engineer at a company is the onboarding process.</p>

<p>It might seem kind of scary, but if you think about it, it&rsquo;s actually pretty fun. You get to dive down a rabbit hole and look at production code that you didn&rsquo;t write. It&rsquo;s getting a new puzzle that you haven&rsquo;t solved yet: you try to figure out how one thing connects to another, where modules and methods exist, how things are namespaced, not to mention learning about new frameworks and gems. I feel like I&rsquo;m entering into new dimensions and travelling through a space-time continuum or something. This also might be attributed to the fact that I&rsquo;ve been  listening exclusively to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOWSTtXxf9s">Interstellar soundtrack</a> for the past two days, but whatever &ndash; you get the point.</p>

<p>My favorite part of the onboarding process is how much I&rsquo;ve been learning. Every new class or module definition brings a new piece of the puzzle that I&rsquo;ve never seen before, but can&rsquo;t wait to learn about. It&rsquo;s kind of crazy that I get paid to read and learn all day, every day &ndash; that&rsquo;s the dream, right?</p>

<p>Anyways, all of this is to say that I&rsquo;ve found and learned about some cool stuff! For example this little ditty: <code>acts_as_paranoid</code>. I saw this in a class definition and my first thought was literally: <em>Damn, that&rsquo;s a great name for a validation!</em> But as it turns out, it&rsquo;s not actually a validation &ndash; it&rsquo;s Rails magic!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are a lot of scary things out there. To start, there are lions and tigers and bears. But if you go a bit below the surface, that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll hit the dark stuff &ndash; the kind of stuff that I was forced to confront when I started as a student at <a href="http://www.flatironschool.com">The Flatiron School</a>.</p>

<p>Sure, learning how to program is really hard &ndash; it&rsquo;s not just learning another language, it&rsquo;s learning an entirely new way to think. But, working on code is far easier than working on yourself. My twelve weeks at The Flatiron School pushed me to deal with some tough thoughts, most of which had always lurked in the skeleton closets of my mind: <em>I don&rsquo;t know if I can do this. I&rsquo;m not cut out for this. I&rsquo;m not prepared. I&rsquo;m not smart enough. I won&rsquo;t fit in. I can&rsquo;t undersand. I won&rsquo;t understand.</em></p>

<p>Most of us have all had these thoughts at some point in our lives, regardless of what we look like or what we do for a living. Some of us have stopped dead in our tracks, sometimes unable to move beyond them at all. But learning to code meant dealing with these fears on a daily basis; at some point, I just stopped listening to them entirely.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During a recent pair programming session, I came to the tough realization that I really know <em>nothing</em> about CSS. Granted, I can add in a <code>div</code> tag here and there, and yes, I can make a responsive page using Twitter Bootstrap like no one&rsquo;s business. But, what do I really know about design? Not as much as I thought I did.</p>

<p>I figured out that this was the case when the designer I was pairing with started using <strong>ems</strong> and <strong>rems</strong>. I should probably preface this and say that I have always been a pixel kind of girl. I was formerly of the mindset that you can have any font size you like &ndash;  as long as it&rsquo;s defined in pixels.</p>

<p>But, after doing a bit of research, I found that ems and rems actually have an interesting history behind them, and are super helpful when it comes to elastic layouts and responsive design.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, I had my first full-day technical interview. It was a thrilling experience, and so much more fun than I expected. Part of that was because I viewed the whole experience not as an evaluation, but rather an opportunity to learn as much as I could from experienced developers. I also knew that, irrespective of whether I did well or not, I&rsquo;d learn some new technologies and tricks. And boy, was that the truth.</p>

<p>I left the interview with a long list of things I&rsquo;d never heard of (<em>why hello, blog posts for the next five Tuesdays!</em>), one of which included the use of decorators in Rails. I was actually kind of surprised that I had never encountered decorators while building my own Rails apps, but it turns out that these are actually pretty advanced topics and there&rsquo;s a good amount of <a href="https://bibwild.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/the-simplest-rails-decorator-implementation-that-just-might-work/">debate on how and when to use decorators</a>, and <a href="http://thepugautomatic.com/2014/03/draper/">whether or not they&rsquo;re actually useful</a>.</p>

<p>But hey, none these discussions apply or make any sense unless you know <em>what</em> a decorator actually is. So, let&rsquo;s find out!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s a brand new year, and with that comes a renewed sense of self. Also: a rather lengthy todo list. Enter <strong>#technicaltuesdays</strong>, or my attempt at beefing up my technical chops by posting a blog post every week &mdash; specifically on Tuesdays, in case it wasn&rsquo;t obvious. (Sorry, Thursday, you were a close second, but you just didn&rsquo;t make the cut.)</p>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s on the menu this week? JavaScript! New year = new me, you guys. Actually, some of my technical interviews have been a bit JavaScript-heavy, so I&rsquo;ve been stepping up my curly bracket game.</p>

<p>In honor of the new year, I wanted to use JavaScript to create a quick &ldquo;New Year&rsquo;s Countdown&rdquo; function. Suffice it to say, <em>it was neither quick nor easy</em>. But I learned about two cool timing events in JavaScript &ndash; <strong>setInterval</strong> and <strong>clearInterval</strong> &ndash; and now you can learn about them, too!</p>
